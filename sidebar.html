            <h1>Vermont Education Reform Analysis</h1>
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>This site critically analyzes Vermont’s proposed <strong>Education Transformation Act of 2025</strong> in relation to past state-led school district centralization efforts in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Mississippi. The proposal aims to consolidate Vermont’s public school system into <strong>five regional districts</strong>, implement a <strong>new foundation-based funding model</strong>, and introduce <strong>expanded school choice mechanisms</strong> that would allow public funds to follow students to private institutions. While proponents argue that these changes will improve efficiency and equity, historical evidence suggests that similar centralization efforts have often led to <strong>increased racial and economic disparities, reduced local democratic control, and weakened public school systems</strong>. </p>
            <p>The aim of this research is to assess the risks and consequences of the proposed law through a comparative analysis of <strong>state takeovers, school funding reforms, and school choice policies in other states</strong>. This report highlights how similar reforms have, in practice, often led to <strong>budget reallocations that favor wealthier districts, the erosion of public school funding, and the deepening of educational segregation</strong>. The research also places the proposal in the broader political context of Vermont’s recent <strong>funding equity reforms</strong>, which sought to balance school resources between wealthy and underfunded districts—reforms that this proposal may seek to <strong>roll back under the guise of efficiency</strong>. </p>
            <p>By examining the language of the proposed bill alongside evidence from past state interventions in education, this report identifies <strong>key risks associated with the legislation</strong> and argues that the bill represents a <strong>step backward for Vermont’s public school system</strong>. The findings underscore the importance of <strong>preserving local governance, maintaining equitable school funding, and resisting the privatization efforts embedded within the bill</strong>. This analysis is intended to inform lawmakers, educators, and community stakeholders about the real consequences of this proposal and to provide a data-driven argument for rejecting policies that threaten Vermont’s commitment to <strong>high-quality, equitable public education for all students</strong>. </p>
            <h3 id="Overview">Overview </h1>
              <p>Vermont’s proposed education transformation law represents a major shift in school governance and finance. The plan would consolidate Vermont’s many school districts into just five regional districts, each with a single school board and central office, and implement a new statewide “foundation” funding formula (<a target="_blank" target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=“Base amount” means a per pupil amount of $13,200.00">citation</a>). The goal, as stated in the bill, is to improve educational quality and equity – providing a base of $13,200 per student (with additional weights for student needs, school size, and sparsity) to ensure all communities can offer a high-quality education (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=bill%20also%20proposes%20to%20transform,education%20financing%20system%20to%20a">citation</a>).
              <p> This analysis examines how similar centralization efforts in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Mississippi have played out, focusing on four key areas: (1) school funding and local control, (2) racial and economic equity, (3) the effectiveness of school choice programs, and (4) academic outcomes under centralized funding models. By comparing Vermont’s proposal to these case studies, we can identify lessons to guide Vermont’s approach. </p>
              </p>
              <h2 id="impact-on-school-funding-and-local-control">Impact on School Funding and Local Control</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Vermont’s Plan:</strong> Vermont’s current system equalizes tax capacity across districts but still allows significant spending variation by local choice (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=raise%20education%20taxes%2C%20leveling%20out,distinctions%20in%20property%20wealth%20among">citation</a>). The new proposal would replace this with a centralized foundation formula and larger districts to ensure more consistent spending per pupil (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=bill%20also%20proposes%20to%20transform,education%20financing%20system%20to%20a">citation</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=raise%20education%20taxes%2C%20leveling%20out,distinctions%20in%20property%20wealth%20among">citation</a>). In practice, this means the State would take a stronger role in allocating education dollars and local decision-making would shift from numerous town school boards to just five regional boards (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=create%20five%20school%20districts%20to,education%20system%20for%20the%20entire">citation</a>). This raises questions about how funding equity and local autonomy will be balanced.

                <strong>Rhode Island:</strong> Prior to 2010, Rhode Island famously lacked a statewide school funding formula – the only state without one (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/new-r-i-school-funding-formula-aims-at-equity/2010/07#:~:text=Rhode%20Island%20had%20been%20the,formula%20for%20distributing%20education%20aid">New R.I. School Funding Formula Aims at Equity</a>). This led to big disparities: some poorer districts spent around \$11,000 per pupil while affluent communities spent over \$19,000 (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/new-r-i-school-funding-formula-aims-at-equity/2010/07#:~:text=For%20years%2C%20the%20state%E2%80%99s%20districts,student%20in%20more%20affluent%20communities">New R.I.

A 2010 reform established a baseline funding amount for every student plus a 40% supplement for each low-income student (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/new-r-i-school-funding-formula-aims-at-equity/2010/07#:~:text=month%20by%20Republican%20Gov,price%20meals%20program">New R.I. School Funding Formula Aims at Equity</a>), explicitly aiming for equitable distribution. The new formula tied aid to enrollment and community wealth, so districts with more students in poverty or less ability to raise local taxes would get more state funding (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/new-r-i-school-funding-formula-aims-at-equity/2010/07#:~:text=The%20new%20formula%20is%20linked,12%20school%20year">New R.I. School Funding Formula Aims at Equity</a>). This <em>centralization of funding</em> made distribution “consistent, transparent, and understood by everyone,” according to the state education commissioner (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/new-r-i-school-funding-formula-aims-at-equity/2010/07#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20is%20about%20equitable%20distribution,%E2%80%9D">New R.I. School Funding Formula Aims at Equity</a>). Most students (71% statewide) benefited from increased funding with this redistribution (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/new-r-i-school-funding-formula-aims-at-equity/2010/07#:~:text=State%20education%20officials%20said%20that,the%20new%20formula%20takes%20effect">New R.I. School Funding Formula Aims at Equity</a>). However, the shift was controversial among communities that had been “benefiting from the current structure” and stood to lose funds – they resisted changes that eroded their local advantage (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/new-r-i-school-funding-formula-aims-at-equity/2010/07#:~:text=%E2%80%9CObviously%2C%20when%20you%20have%20a,%E2%80%9D">New R.I. School Funding Formula Aims at Equity</a>). Rhode Island did not eliminate local school boards, but the <em>state did intervene in governance</em> in extreme cases. Notably, after chronically low performance and a scathing review of Providence’s schools, the state took over Providence Public Schools in 2019. This move stripped authority from the city’s school board and mayor, placing control with the Rhode Island Dept. of Education (RIDE). The takeover (enabled by the state’s “Crowley Act”) was extended through 2027, though state officials now discuss returning Providence to local control by 2026 (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2025/02/providence-schools-could-return-to-local-control-by-summer-2026-state-leaders-say#:~:text=PPSD%20has%20been%20under%20state,to%202027%20in%20August%202024">Providence schools could return to local control by summer 2026, state leaders say - The Brown Daily Herald</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2025/02/providence-schools-could-return-to-local-control-by-summer-2026-state-leaders-say#:~:text=PPSD%20has%20been%20under%20state,until%202027%20this%20past%20August">Providence schools could return to local control by summer 2026, state leaders say - The Brown Daily Herald</a>). Community members have pressed for a quicker return of local governance, feeling disenfranchised by the loss of local control (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2025/02/providence-schools-could-return-to-local-control-by-summer-2026-state-leaders-say#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSome%20people%20have%20asked%20us,%E2%80%9D">Providence schools could return to local control by summer 2026, state leaders say - The Brown Daily Herald</a>). Rhode Island’s experience illustrates that a more centralized funding system can equalize resources, but removing local decision-making authority – as in Providence – can provoke community backlash.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Massachusetts undertook a sweeping reform in 1993 that <em>increased state responsibility for school funding</em> while setting new standards. The Education Reform Act of 1993 created a “foundation budget” for each district (similar to what Vermont proposes) to ensure an adequate baseline of funding statewide (<a target="_blank" href="https://pioneerinstitute.org/common_core/how-massachusetts-showed-the-way-on-education-reform/#:~:text=Beginning%20in%201993%2C%20Massachusetts%E2%80%99%20SAT,administration%20of%20NAEP%20except%20one">How Massachusetts Showed the Way on Education Reform | School Choice</a>). In exchange for massive increases in state aid, districts had to adhere to state curriculum frameworks and testing – effectively a bargain of <strong>more funding for more state oversight</strong> (<a target="_blank" href="https://pioneerinstitute.org/common_core/how-massachusetts-showed-the-way-on-education-reform/#:~:text=it">How Massachusetts Showed the Way on Education Reform | School Choice</a>). This reform kept local school committees in place, so local control over day-to-day operations remained, but it did somewhat diminish local autonomy by tying funding to state-defined accountability measures. In later years, Massachusetts also centralized control in specific districts that were underperforming. For example, in 2011 the state placed Lawrence Public Schools into receivership, removing the locally elected board and empowering a state-appointed receiver with all the authority of the superintendent and school board (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/rappaport/files/thirdway%20v5.pdf#:~:text=expansive%20authorities,of%20the%20collective%20bargaining%20agreement">thirdway.indd</a>). This was enabled by a state law and was part of a broader trend of state takeovers of struggling districts. While most Massachusetts communities retain local governance, the Lawrence case shows the state will suspend local control in the interest of drastic improvement. Local reaction in Lawrence was mixed – there was concern about lost local voice, but over time some community leaders cautiously supported the changes as the district began to show signs of improvement (discussed more below). In general, Massachusetts’ approach demonstrates that <strong>centralized funding can coexist with local governance</strong>, but the state may assert control if accountability falters.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Mississippi:</strong> Mississippi’s school funding and governance have also seen centralizing efforts, though with different challenges. The state uses the Mississippi Adequate Education Program (MAEP) as a funding formula, intended to provide a base level of funding for all districts. In practice, however, MAEP has often been underfunded by the legislature – for example, in the current year Mississippi’s public schools are funded \$176 million below what the formula calls for (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CA%20lot%20of%20those%20programs,%E2%80%9D">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>). This chronic underfunding means that many districts, especially high-poverty ones, don’t get enough resources, perpetuating inequities. Additionally, Mississippi law includes a provision known as the “27% rule” which caps the required local contribution at 27% of the formula’s cost (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=%241%2C000%20in%20assessed%20property%20value,the%20provision%20needs%20closer%20examination">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>). This effectively lets property-wealthy districts tax themselves less while poorer districts must effort more – a policy critics say benefits wealthier (often majority-white) communities at the expense of poorer (often majority-Black) ones (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=%241%2C000%20in%20assessed%20property%20value,the%20provision%20needs%20closer%20examination">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>). On governance, Mississippi has frequently intervened in local districts deemed failing. Dozens of districts have been taken over by the state in recent decades (Hazlehurst, Yazoo City, Jackson at one point, etc.), dissolving local boards during the intervention (<a target="_blank" href="http://hechingerreport.org/state-takeovers-fixing-mississippis-failing-districts/#:~:text=Mississippi%20District%20Takeovers">Are state takeovers fixing Mississippi’s failing districts?</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="http://hechingerreport.org/state-takeovers-fixing-mississippis-failing-districts/#:~:text=9.%20Indianola%202009,Present">Are state takeovers fixing Mississippi’s failing districts?</a>). The state even created a <em>Mississippi Achievement School District</em>, a state-run entity to absorb and reform some of the lowest-performing districts. Furthermore, Mississippi has pursued <em>forced district consolidations</em>: in the 2010s, the legislature mandated mergers of several small districts to form larger ones, aiming for cost efficiency. For example, in 2014 it merged several districts in the Delta, and a recent proposal (HB1431 in 2025) would abolish all smaller districts and merge them into one countywide district per county (<a target="_blank" href="https://thebookchambersite.com/2025/01/31/educational-leadership-insights-mississippi-hb1431-and-the-complexity-of-consolidating-school-districts/#:~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20the%20opening%20line%20to,APPOINTED%20COUNTY%20SUPERINTENDENT%20OF%20EDUCATION">Educational Leadership Insights: Mississippi HB1431 and the Complexity of Consolidating School Districts | The Book Chamber</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://thebookchambersite.com/2025/01/31/educational-leadership-insights-mississippi-hb1431-and-the-complexity-of-consolidating-school-districts/#:~:text=ALL%20MUNICIPAL%20SEPARATE%2C%20CONSOLIDATED%2C%20LINE,APPOINTED%20COUNTY%20SUPERINTENDENT%20OF%20EDUCATION">Educational Leadership Insights: Mississippi HB1431 and the Complexity of Consolidating School Districts | The Book Chamber</a>). Community response in Mississippi to such consolidation has often been negative, especially in rural areas. Residents fear losing their community’s identity and voice if their local school board is subsumed into a county system (<a target="_blank" href="https://thebookchambersite.com/2025/01/31/educational-leadership-insights-mississippi-hb1431-and-the-complexity-of-consolidating-school-districts/#:~:text=each%20with%20unique%20needs%20and,cutter%E2%80%9D%20approach">Educational Leadership Insights: Mississippi HB1431 and the Complexity of Consolidating School Districts | The Book Chamber</a>). They worry a one-size-fits-all district will overlook unique local needs – as one commentator noted, centralizing administration could impose a “cookie-cutter” approach that dilutes the local engagement which fuels school success in close-knit communities (<a target="_blank" href="https://thebookchambersite.com/2025/01/31/educational-leadership-insights-mississippi-hb1431-and-the-complexity-of-consolidating-school-districts/#:~:text=county%2C%20the%20state%20risks%20diluting,needs%20of%20smaller%2C%20less%20influential">Educational Leadership Insights: Mississippi HB1431 and the Complexity of Consolidating School Districts | The Book Chamber</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://thebookchambersite.com/2025/01/31/educational-leadership-insights-mississippi-hb1431-and-the-complexity-of-consolidating-school-districts/#:~:text=addressing%20localized%20issues%2C%20from%20personally,and%20that%20matters%20to%20people">Educational Leadership Insights: Mississippi HB1431 and the Complexity of Consolidating School Districts | The Book Chamber</a>). While consolidation might reduce administrative overhead, many Mississippians are mindful that <em>efficiency gains don’t necessarily translate into better classrooms</em>. In summary, Mississippi’s experience shows that without adequate funding, centralization can ring hollow, and that removing local control – whether via takeovers or mergers – often meets resistance and can disrupt community support for schools.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Takeaway:</strong> Across these states, centralizing school funding has generally improved equity in dollars spent, but it often comes at the cost of local control. States like Massachusetts and Rhode Island demonstrate that a well-designed funding formula can channel more resources to the neediest districts (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/new-r-i-school-funding-formula-aims-at-equity/2010/07#:~:text=For%20years%2C%20the%20state%E2%80%99s%20districts,student%20in%20more%20affluent%20communities">New R.I. School Funding Formula Aims at Equity</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/new-r-i-school-funding-formula-aims-at-equity/2010/07#:~:text=State%20education%20officials%20said%20that,the%20new%20formula%20takes%20effect">New R.I. School Funding Formula Aims at Equity</a>), which is precisely Vermont’s intent in moving to a weighted foundation formula. However, when governance is centralized – whether by consolidating districts or state takeovers – it stirs strong feelings. Local communities tend to value their input in school decisions, so reforms must consider ways to include local voices. Vermont can look to these cases and anticipate both the financial benefits (more uniform funding effort) and the pushback (fear of losing local say). The Vermont proposal explicitly acknowledges that “significant change to the current system” is required to meet the State’s constitutional duty of equal education (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=provide%20every%20student%20with%20an,to%20learn%20to%20high%20performance">citation</a>). The challenge will be managing that change so that <em>funding inequities are fixed without alienating the communities schools serve</em>.
              </p>
              <h2 id="racial-and-economic-equity-considerations">Racial and Economic Equity Considerations</h2>
              <p>One of Vermont’s core motivations for transformation is to <strong>close demographic achievement gaps</strong> and ensure quality education “without regard to town of residence” (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=provide%20every%20student%20with%20an,to%20learn%20to%20high%20performance">citation</a>). By consolidating districts and pooling resources, Vermont hopes to reduce the link between a community’s wealth and the quality of its schools. Other states’ experiences reveal both the promises and pitfalls of centralization for racial and economic equity. </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Rhode Island:</strong> The adoption of a statewide funding formula in 2010 was in large part about equity. By providing a uniform base per-student and extra funds for poverty, Rhode Island aimed to steer money toward districts like Providence, Pawtucket, Central Falls, and Woonsocket, which serve higher proportions of low-income and minority students (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/new-r-i-school-funding-formula-aims-at-equity/2010/07#:~:text=The%20new%20formula%20is%20linked,12%20school%20year">New R.I. School Funding Formula Aims at Equity</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/new-r-i-school-funding-formula-aims-at-equity/2010/07#:~:text=For%20years%2C%20the%20state%E2%80%99s%20districts,student%20in%20more%20affluent%20communities">New R.I. School Funding Formula Aims at Equity</a>). This was a corrective to decades of politicized funding that had left poorer (often more racially diverse) districts under-resourced. Indeed, the disparities prior to reform disproportionately hurt communities of color in Rhode Island’s urban core. The new formula was <em>designed to close those gaps</em>, and officials touted that it would “ensure a good education for every Rhode Island student and make sure we close achievement gaps” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/new-r-i-school-funding-formula-aims-at-equity/2010/07#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20is%20about%20equitable%20distribution,%E2%80%9D">New R.I. School Funding Formula Aims at Equity</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/new-r-i-school-funding-formula-aims-at-equity/2010/07#:~:text=commissioner,%E2%80%9D">New R.I. School Funding Formula Aims at Equity</a>). However, equity is not only about funding; it’s also about power and voice. In Providence – a district with predominantly Hispanic and black students – the state’s 2019 takeover raised sensitive issues of race and local disenfranchisement. Education scholar Domingo Morel (in <em>Takeover: Race, Education, and American Democracy</em>) points out that state takeovers nationally often happen in minority-led districts, effectively stripping political representation from communities of color. Providence fit this pattern, and community activists there have argued that the takeover overlooked community input and might not address deeper inequities like housing and poverty that affect schools (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.rilegislature.gov/pressrelease/PressReleaseFiles/Report%20on%20Providence%20Schools%20-%20Simon%20and%20Kislak.pdf#:~:text=In%20his%20book%20Takeover%3A%20Race%2C,present%20takeover%20e%20orts%2C">[PDF] Report on Providence Schools - Simon and Kislak</a>). Thus, while Rhode Island’s funding formula made strides in economic equity, the governance intervention in its most diverse district highlights a <em>tension between equity and self-determination</em>. The state may have felt drastic action was needed for Providence’s mostly low-income students, but doing so meant sidelining a community that is itself marginalized – a trade-off Vermonters should weigh if any similar moves are considered.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Massachusetts’ 1993 reforms provide a strong example of equity gains. The state pumped billions of additional dollars into historically underfunded school systems (largely urban districts with high concentrations of low-income, Black, and Latino students). Over the subsequent decade, <em>outcomes for those student groups improved markedly</em>, and the gap between rich and poor districts narrowed. By 2005, Massachusetts not only led the nation overall on standardized tests, but its Black and Hispanic students had made faster progress, helping narrow achievement gaps (<a target="_blank" href="https://pioneerinstitute.org/common_core/how-massachusetts-showed-the-way-on-education-reform/#:~:text=Beginning%20in%201993%2C%20Massachusetts%E2%80%99%20SAT,administration%20of%20NAEP%20except%20one">How Massachusetts Showed the Way on Education Reform | School Choice</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://pioneerinstitute.org/common_core/how-massachusetts-showed-the-way-on-education-reform/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20across,more%20rapidly%20than%20those%20of">How Massachusetts Showed the Way on Education Reform | School Choice</a>). Researchers noted that Massachusetts was among the states making the most progress in reducing race- and class-based achievement gaps in the late 1990s and early 2000s (<a target="_blank" href="https://pioneerinstitute.org/common_core/how-massachusetts-showed-the-way-on-education-reform/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20across,more%20rapidly%20than%20those%20of">How Massachusetts Showed the Way on Education Reform | School Choice</a>). This suggests that <strong>centralized, equitable funding coupled with strong standards can advance racial and economic justice</strong> in education. However, Massachusetts also illustrates how new inequities can emerge through school choice policies (addressed more in the next section). The introduction of charter schools and other choice mechanisms in the 1990s had unintended equity consequences. Charter schools in Massachusetts, especially in Boston, serve primarily minority students and have delivered impressive test score gains for many. Yet, civil rights groups have pointed out that charters often serve fewer English language learners and students with severe disabilities compared to the traditional public schools (<a target="_blank" href="https://lawyersforcivilrights.org/our-impact/education/students-civil-rights-groups-react-to-courts-dismissal-of-charter-cap-case-in-massachusetts/#:~:text=In%20its%20brief%2C%20the%20group,discipline%20on%20students%20of%20color">Lawyers for Civil Rights</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://lawyersforcivilrights.org/our-impact/education/students-civil-rights-groups-react-to-courts-dismissal-of-charter-cap-case-in-massachusetts/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBoston,in%20Boston%20Public%20Schools">Lawyers for Civil Rights</a>). In other words, a segment of disadvantaged students benefited greatly from charters, but those with the highest needs were underrepresented and left in district schools, which could <em>exacerbate inequities among high-need populations</em>. This became a civil rights issue: the NAACP in Massachusetts argued that expanding charter enrollment would drain resources from the very school systems that serve the neediest, “funding two separate school systems” and leaving one of them with a higher share of high-need (and costly-to-educate) students (<a target="_blank" href="https://lawyersforcivilrights.org/our-impact/education/students-civil-rights-groups-react-to-courts-dismissal-of-charter-cap-case-in-massachusetts/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20applaud%20the%20ruling%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%C2%A0Juan,%E2%80%9D">Lawyers for Civil Rights</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://lawyersforcivilrights.org/our-impact/education/students-civil-rights-groups-react-to-courts-dismissal-of-charter-cap-case-in-massachusetts/#:~:text=In%20its%20brief%2C%20the%20group,discipline%20on%20students%20of%20color">Lawyers for Civil Rights</a>). In 2016, Massachusetts voters sided with this equity argument, rejecting a proposal to lift the cap on charters. The lesson from Massachusetts is that <strong>equity gains from funding reform can be undermined if new forms of segregation or resource diversion appear</strong>. Vermont’s proposal does include school choice elements (such as intra-district choice and the option to send students to other public or approved independent high schools) (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=,district%20grade%20K%E2%80%938%20choice">citation</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=A%20school%20board%20shall%20designate,one%20public%20or%20independent%20school">citation</a>). Vermont will need to monitor these provisions to ensure they don’t inadvertently create inequitable tracks where, say, more privileged families navigate choice to their advantage while others are left behind.

                <strong>Mississippi:</strong> Perhaps the starkest lessons on equity come from Mississippi’s history. In Mississippi, discussions of “local control” and “school choice” have long been intertwined with race. After the Supreme Court’s 1954 <em>Brown v. Board</em> decision outlawed segregated schools, white Mississippi leaders resisted integration fiercely. For a time, they promoted <strong>“freedom of choice” plans explicitly to avoid meaningful desegregation</strong> (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/then-and-now-when-school-choice-creates-a-divide/#:~:text=During%20legal%20segregation%20years%2C%20it,its%20%E2%80%9Cfreedom%20of%20choice%E2%80%9D%20strategy">Then and Now: When ‘School Choice’ Creates a Divide - Mississippi Free Press</a>). These plans nominally allowed black students to transfer to white schools, but in practice, only a few brave families tried (often facing harassment and violence) and the school systems remained segregated (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/then-and-now-when-school-choice-creates-a-divide/#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cfreedom%20of%20choice%E2%80%9D%20strategy">Then and Now: When ‘School Choice’ Creates a Divide - Mississippi Free Press</a>). Historian Joseph Crespino noted that Mississippi’s so-called freedom-of-choice system “left segregated patterns… all but untouched,” revealing that the concept had “little to do with either freedom or choice” for black students (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/then-and-now-when-school-choice-creates-a-divide/#:~:text=School%20districts%20allowed%20parents%20to,children%E2%80%99s%20safety%20in%20white%20schools">Then and Now: When ‘School Choice’ Creates a Divide - Mississippi Free Press</a>). When court orders finally forced integration around 1970, many white families fled to private <strong>“segregation academies,”</strong> which sprang up across Mississippi to maintain all-white schooling (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/then-and-now-when-school-choice-creates-a-divide/#:~:text=Private%20%E2%80%9Csegregation%20academies%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94which%20only%20allowed,to%20desegregate%20in%20early%201970">Then and Now: When ‘School Choice’ Creates a Divide - Mississippi Free Press</a>). The state’s first voucher-like programs were designed to subsidize these academies for white families (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=The%20fight%20over%20vouchers%20stretches,remain%20mostly%20white%20and%20receive">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>). This painful history means that in Mississippi, <strong>“school choice” has often been a code word for racial separation</strong>. Fast-forward to today: Mississippi’s public schools are now mostly African American (only ~44% of public school students are white, in a state that is 59% white in population) (<a target="_blank" href="http://hechingerreport.org/racial-segregation-continues-to-impact-quality-of-education-in-mississippi-and-nationwide/#:~:text=The%20effect%20of%20racial%20segregation,schools%20in%202010%20were%20white">The effect of racial segregation on education in Mississippi</a>). Many of those private academies still exist and remain overwhelmingly white. Recent investigations found that some of these segregation academies even benefit from public funds (through state-sanctioned tax-credit scholarships), effectively diverting taxpayer money to virtually all-white schools (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/mississippi-segregation-academies-taxpayer-dollars-1960s#:~:text=Segregation%20Academies%20in%20Mississippi%20Are,Central%20Holmes%20is%20one">Segregation Academies in Mississippi Are Benefiting From Public ...</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/mississippi-segregation-academies-taxpayer-dollars-1960s#:~:text=,Central%20Holmes%20is%20one">Segregation Academies in Mississippi Are Benefiting From Public ...</a>). On the public side, Mississippi’s underfunding of schools hits majority-Black districts hardest, since those communities have less property wealth to compensate. Equity advocates like the Parents’ Campaign argue that until the state fully funds MAEP – the formula that is supposed to level the field – children in high-poverty, predominantly Black districts are denied equal opportunity (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=Legislators%20could%20help%20a%20lot%E2%80%94make,%E2%80%9D">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99ve%20run%20the%20numbers%20on,%E2%80%9D">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>). They also point out that proposals to expand vouchers would create <strong>“separate but unequal” systems</strong>: one public system that is accountable to taxpayers, and another private system (often de facto segregated) that would receive public money without public accountability (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=Loome%20is%20concerned%20about%20the,the%20funds%20for%20voucher%20programs">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>). In the words of Parents’ Campaign director Nancy Loome, “if we can’t afford to adequately support [public] schools…, it makes no sense to be spending state money on schools that operate in private and don’t have any accountability… [it would be] two separate education systems, ... separate but unequal” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20we%20can%E2%80%99t%20afford%20to,%E2%80%9D">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>). Mississippi’s example is a cautionary tale: even well-intended central policies can falter if not guarded against racial and economic biases. Centralization must be coupled with vigilance that resources <strong>truly reach underfunded, diverse schools rather than flowing out to wealthier enclaves</strong>. Vermont’s framers seem aware of this – the proposal’s weighted funding for poverty and small rural schools (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=year%202025%2C%20with%20additional%20weights,student%20need%2C%20school%20scale%2C%20and">citation</a>) is designed to protect vulnerable populations. The key will be following through: ensuring that equity weights are sufficient, that all regions (urban, rural, high-poverty) have a voice in the new system, and that any choice mechanisms do not reopen the door to stratified schooling.

              <h2 id="effectiveness-of-school-choice-programs">Effectiveness of School Choice Programs</h2>
              <p>School choice – including charter schools, vouchers, and open enrollment policies – has been promoted in various states as a way to spur competition and improvement. Vermont’s bill touches on school choice by requiring districts to offer intra-district choice at the K-8 level and to designate at least one high school (public or independent) as a “School Choice School” open to non-resident students on a limited basis (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=,district%20grade%20K%E2%80%938%20choice">citation</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=the%20district%2C%20the%20school%20board,on%20grade%209%E2%80%9312%20school%20choice">citation</a>). To glean what impact such policies might have, it’s instructive to see how choice has affected funding and school quality in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Mississippi. </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Massachusetts introduced charter schools as part of the 1993 reform, and it also has an inter-district choice program (where districts can opt to accept students from other communities). The charter sector in Massachusetts is relatively high-performing by national standards – for instance, Boston’s charter schools have been shown in studies to significantly raise test scores for their mostly low-income, minority student bodies. Some charters boast impressive outcomes (e.g., one Boston charter reports 100% college acceptance for its 98% minority student population) (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/ed-magazine/17/05/battle-over-charter-schools#:~:text=charters%20that%20Senior%20Lecturer%20Kay,Report%E2%80%99s%20top%20100%20high%20schools">The Battle Over Charter Schools | Harvard Graduate School of Education</a>). However, the success for students who attend charter schools must be weighed against the broader system effects. In Massachusetts, when a student attends a charter, the state funding associated with that student follows them out of the district school’s budget. The state does provide some transition aid to districts losing students, but district leaders often complain that charter expansion forces painful cuts in neighborhood public schools. Opponents of charter growth emphasize that charters educate a subset of students, <strong>often not fully representative of all high-need children</strong>, yet they siphon funds from the general public system. In a 2016 court case, civil rights groups cited evidence that Massachusetts charters <strong>“divert millions of dollars from traditional public schools each year, yet serve proportionately far fewer students with disabilities and English language learners”</strong> (<a target="_blank" href="https://lawyersforcivilrights.org/our-impact/education/students-civil-rights-groups-react-to-courts-dismissal-of-charter-cap-case-in-massachusetts/#:~:text=In%20its%20brief%2C%20the%20group,discipline%20on%20students%20of%20color">Lawyers for Civil Rights</a>). They argued that expanding charters would worsen inequity and “harm public education overall” by creating a parallel system competing for the same limited funds (<a target="_blank" href="https://lawyersforcivilrights.org/our-impact/education/students-civil-rights-groups-react-to-courts-dismissal-of-charter-cap-case-in-massachusetts/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Court%20clearly%20saw%20the,%E2%80%9D">Lawyers for Civil Rights</a>). The NAACP in Massachusetts took a firm stance that eliminating the charter cap would not eliminate achievement gaps but instead would under-resource the schools that serve the most challenged students (<a target="_blank" href="https://lawyersforcivilrights.org/our-impact/education/students-civil-rights-groups-react-to-courts-dismissal-of-charter-cap-case-in-massachusetts/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20applaud%20the%20ruling%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%C2%A0Juan,%E2%80%9D">Lawyers for Civil Rights</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://lawyersforcivilrights.org/our-impact/education/students-civil-rights-groups-react-to-courts-dismissal-of-charter-cap-case-in-massachusetts/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Court%20clearly%20saw%20the,%E2%80%9D">Lawyers for Civil Rights</a>). Voters seemed to agree – a statewide referendum to allow more charters was defeated, keeping the cap in place. Traditional inter-district school choice in Massachusetts has had modest uptake, with some students choosing to attend schools in nearby towns. This can benefit families (for example, allowing a student in a low-performing district to transfer to a better-resourced district if space is available), but it tends to be <strong>one-directional</strong> – typically from poorer towns to richer ones. That means the sending districts lose students and funding, potentially <em>contributing to decline in those already struggling schools</em>. In short, Massachusetts’ experience shows that while choice programs can create pockets of excellence, they also introduce fiscal stress on public school systems and <strong>have not been a systemic cure-all</strong> for educational woes. Indeed, despite charters’ presence, Massachusetts’ overall success is usually attributed more to its strong standards and funding equity than to choice alone.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Rhode Island:</strong> Rhode Island has a small charter school sector and some intra-state choice as well. Charters in Rhode Island similarly draw state and local per-pupil funds away from district schools. The state’s funding formula even includes a provision that money follows the student to whatever public school (district or charter) they attend. This means that districts like Providence or Central Falls not only lose the state aid for each student who enrolls in a charter, but in some cases have to pay additional local funds to the charter school as well. Rhode Island’s charters are relatively new (most started in the 2000s and 2010s) and results have been mixed. Some charter schools serving low-income communities (like the Achievement First network in Providence) have seen higher test scores than the district average, but others have struggled. Meanwhile, the <em>scale</em> of charter enrollment is still small compared to Massachusetts. As of the mid-2010s, RI charters served only a few thousand students. However, the fiscal impact on small districts can be noticeable. For example, if a few dozen students leave a tiny district for a charter, that could strip hundreds of thousands of dollars from that district’s budget, potentially forcing cuts in programs or staff. Community responses in Rhode Island have been divided: families who get into a charter may be satisfied, but those in district schools often perceive that <em>charters are draining resources</em>. There have been political fights over moratoriums on new charter schools, with some lawmakers arguing that expansion would undermine traditional public schools (an argument similar to the one in Massachusetts). It’s also worth noting Rhode Island has inter-district choice through its statewide vocational-technical schools and some open enrollment options. As with Massachusetts, these generally help individual students find a better fit, but if not managed carefully, they can leave sending districts worse off. In summary, Rhode Island’s school choice programs have had <strong>limited but important effects on funding</strong>, requiring the state to rethink how to compensate districts and ensure that one school’s gain isn’t simply another school’s loss.

                <strong>Mississippi:</strong> Mississippi was late to embrace modern school choice programs, largely due to resistance from those concerned about their impact on public schools (and memories of the segregation academy era). In the last decade, however, Mississippi’s legislature enacted several “school choice” measures: it approved charter schools (the first opened in 2015) and created a limited voucher program for special education students (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=Over%20the%20last%20decade%2C%20the,in%20recent%20years%20have%20failed">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>). Today, Mississippi has only a handful of charter schools – all in either the capital city of Jackson or in the Delta region – and a modest special-needs voucher (officially an “Education Scholarship Account”) that lets a few hundred students with disabilities attend private schools with public funds. These programs, while not large, have still sparked controversy. Charter schools in Jackson have drawn students from the Jackson Public Schools district, which is overwhelmingly African American and historically underfunded. The charters are publicly funded but operate independently, with no oversight by the local elected school board – a point of contention for those who see it as an erosion of local control similar to a state takeover. Financially, the Mississippi charter law requires the local district to share a portion of its funding for each resident student who enrolls in a charter, which Jackson’s leaders have said deprives the already struggling district of resources for the students who remain. The academic results of Mississippi charters are still emerging; they have not shown dramatic outperformance of public schools, and one charter in Jackson was threatened with closure for poor results after a few years. On the voucher side, the <em>outcomes have been mixed and oversight weak</em>. Investigations found that some private schools receiving Mississippi’s special-ed vouchers lacked appropriate services, meaning public funds were used with little accountability – echoing Nancy Loome’s warning that public dollars flowing to unaccountable schools risks a “separate but unequal” situation (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=Loome%20is%20concerned%20about%20the,the%20funds%20for%20voucher%20programs">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>). Moreover, attempts to broaden vouchers (for instance, to allow any student to take public money to private school) have repeatedly failed in the state legislature, due to a coalition of rural Republicans and Democrats who fear harming public schools (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=Over%20the%20last%20decade%2C%20the,in%20recent%20years%20have%20failed">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>). One cannot discuss Mississippi and school choice without acknowledging that many white families already <em>opt out</em> of the public system entirely via private schools; thus, “choice” in the form of charters/vouchers in Mississippi hasn’t enticed those families back, but rather could end up further <em>reducing the resources for the predominantly black public schools</em>. Historical context underscores this: after integration, white flight to private schools led to steep declines in support for public education among segments of Mississippi’s population (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/then-and-now-when-school-choice-creates-a-divide/#:~:text=Before%20the%201954%20Brown%20vs,for%20%E2%80%9Cschool%20choice%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94began%20in%20earnest">Then and Now: When ‘School Choice’ Creates a Divide - Mississippi Free Press</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/then-and-now-when-school-choice-creates-a-divide/#:~:text=Mississippi%20didn%E2%80%99t%20have%20an%20interest,for%20%E2%80%9Cschool%20choice%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94began%20in%20earnest">Then and Now: When ‘School Choice’ Creates a Divide - Mississippi Free Press</a>). In effect, public schools lost not only enrollment but political capital. Any program that subsidizes private education (through vouchers or tax credits) risks extending that legacy.

              <p>
                <strong>Overall Assessment:</strong> The effectiveness of school choice programs in improving educational outcomes is highly debated. In these states, there is little evidence that choice policies alone rejuvenated public education broadly. Massachusetts achieved top-ranked schools primarily through standards and funding equity; charters played a supplementary role and came with trade-offs. Rhode Island and Mississippi have seen that while a subset of students might benefit from alternatives, those left in the traditional system can be negatively impacted if funding is diverted. Additionally, <strong>segregation and disparity often increase</strong> when choice is not deliberately managed. For instance, higher-performing charters sometimes have lower proportions of high-need students, effectively concentrating challenges back in the district schools (<a target="_blank" href="https://lawyersforcivilrights.org/our-impact/education/students-civil-rights-groups-react-to-courts-dismissal-of-charter-cap-case-in-massachusetts/#:~:text=In%20its%20brief%2C%20the%20group,discipline%20on%20students%20of%20color">Lawyers for Civil Rights</a>). In Mississippi, choice has historically been associated with segregating by race and class (public vs. private systems) (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=The%20fight%20over%20vouchers%20stretches,remain%20mostly%20white%20and%20receive">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=Loome%20is%20concerned%20about%20the,the%20funds%20for%20voucher%20programs">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>). For Vermont, which values its small community schools and already has some unique choice elements (like “tuitioning” students from towns without schools), the key will be to design choice in a way that <strong>expands opportunity without undermining public schools’ stability or equity</strong>. That might mean capping the scale of choice programs, ensuring funding follows students in a way that doesn’t cripple the sending schools, and holding any participating schools (public or private) to comparable standards so that choice isn’t an escape from accountability. Vermont’s bill does require that any independent school used as a “School Choice School” meet state education quality standards and nondiscrimination requirements (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=schools,by%20the%20district%20is%20an">citation</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=school%20choice%20school%2C%20then%20the,board%20shall%20annually%20announce%20the">citation</a>) – a nod toward maintaining fairness. The state can learn from others that choice works best as a carefully controlled supplement to a strong public system, not a replacement for it.

              <h2 id="impact-of-centralized-funding-models-on-academic-outcomes">Impact of Centralized Funding Models on Academic Outcomes</h2>
              <p>Centralizing school funding and governance is typically justified by the expectation that it will improve student outcomes. Vermont’s proposed transformation is rooted in an “Evidence-Based Model” for adequate funding – the idea being that if every school has the resources needed for best practices, student achievement will rise substantially (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=,Based">citation</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=and%20career,to%20those%20standards%20would%20substantially">citation</a>). How realistic is this expectation? The record from other states shows some successes as well as cautionary tales regarding academic results under centralized models. </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Massachusetts stands out as a success story in terms of academic outcomes following funding reform. After the 1993 centralization of funding (via the Chapter 70 formula) and the accompanying standards-and-accountability regime, student performance climbed dramatically. Over the next decade, Massachusetts students rose to <strong>first in the nation</strong> on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in 4th and 8th grade reading and math, a status they have maintained on almost every NAEP administration since the early 2000s (<a target="_blank" href="https://pioneerinstitute.org/common_core/how-massachusetts-showed-the-way-on-education-reform/#:~:text=Beginning%20in%201993%2C%20Massachusetts%E2%80%99%20SAT,administration%20of%20NAEP%20except%20one">How Massachusetts Showed the Way on Education Reform | School Choice</a>). SAT scores in the state increased for 13 consecutive years beginning in 1993 (<a target="_blank" href="https://pioneerinstitute.org/common_core/how-massachusetts-showed-the-way-on-education-reform/#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20the%20reform,the%20law%E2%80%99s%20authors%20had%20hoped">How Massachusetts Showed the Way on Education Reform | School Choice</a>). Importantly, these gains were not limited to affluent districts – improvement was broad-based, showing that the infusion of funds and focus on rigorous curricula helped lift lower-performing schools. By many accounts, Massachusetts “showed the way” by marrying equitable funding with high expectations (<a target="_blank" href="https://pioneerinstitute.org/common_core/how-massachusetts-showed-the-way-on-education-reform/#:~:text=Beginning%20in%201993%2C%20Massachusetts%E2%80%99%20SAT,administration%20of%20NAEP%20except%20one">How Massachusetts Showed the Way on Education Reform | School Choice</a>). The achievement gap between demographics, while still present, narrowed during the initial years of reform as lower-income and minority students’ scores improved faster than those of their peers (<a target="_blank" href="https://pioneerinstitute.org/common_core/how-massachusetts-showed-the-way-on-education-reform/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20across,more%20rapidly%20than%20those%20of">How Massachusetts Showed the Way on Education Reform | School Choice</a>). In short, <strong>a well-funded, centralized model coupled with strong educational programs led to measurable gains in student performance</strong> in Massachusetts. It’s worth noting, however, that sustaining those gains requires continuous commitment. In recent years, Massachusetts has faced plateauing or even dipping scores (exacerbated by the pandemic), reminding us that reform is not a one-time fix but an ongoing process (<a target="_blank" href="https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/where-did-education-reform-go-wrong-in-massachusetts/#:~:text=Massachusetts%3F%20commonwealthbeacon,The">Where did education reform go wrong in Massachusetts?</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/we-need-to-confront-the-states-long-decline-in-student-achievement/#:~:text=We%20need%20to%20confront%20the,MCAS%20tests%20announced%20in%20September">We need to confront the state&#39;s long decline in student achievement</a>). Still, the Massachusetts example provides proof that centralized funding models <em>can</em> significantly boost outcomes when done right – it’s often cited that Massachusetts’ comprehensive reforms made it a national leader in education.

                <strong>Rhode Island:</strong> Rhode Island’s experience with centralized funding is newer and the outcome picture is mixed. The 2010 funding formula certainly corrected funding imbalances, but the state did not accompany it with an overhaul of standards or accountability as dramatic as Massachusetts had done (Massachusetts had also implemented MCAS testing and a rigorous curriculum framework). Throughout the 2010s, Rhode Island’s academic performance remained mediocre – generally below Massachusetts and Connecticut on New England common assessments and NAEP. By 2019, Rhode Island officials were candid about a crisis in Providence schools, where student outcomes were shockingly low (e.g. very small percentages proficient in reading and math). This prompted the state takeover of Providence. The hope was that direct state management and injection of resources would <em>turn around</em> the district. After a few years, however, results have been limited. A 2021 report noted that under state control, Providence made some administrative improvements but still struggled with deep-rooted issues, and student achievement had not yet seen a marked uptick (<a target="_blank" href="http://hechingerreport.org/state-takeovers-fixing-mississippis-failing-districts/#:~:text=Hazlehurst%E2%80%99s%20inconsistent%20and%20often%20lackluster,mixed%20over%20whether%20takeovers%20work">Are state takeovers fixing Mississippi’s failing districts?</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="http://hechingerreport.org/state-takeovers-fixing-mississippis-failing-districts/#:~:text=A%202004%20report%20from%20the,is%20usually%20mixed%2C%20the%20report">Are state takeovers fixing Mississippi’s failing districts?</a>). In fact, a review a year into the takeover found little substantive change in classroom outcomes, leading to frustration among parents and teachers. RIDE (the state education department) has outlined goals for improvement and is requiring Providence to hit certain targets before returning to local control (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2025/02/providence-schools-could-return-to-local-control-by-summer-2026-state-leaders-say#:~:text=RIDE%E2%80%99s%20framework%20for%20ending%20the,school%20board%20and%20transition%20planning">Providence schools could return to local control by summer 2026, state leaders say - The Brown Daily Herald</a>). This underscores that <strong>centralized control by itself is not a guarantee of quick academic gains</strong> – especially in an under-resourced, high-poverty setting. It may be that deeper changes (like improving teacher recruitment, addressing facilities, tackling absenteeism, etc.) are needed beyond what centralization can immediately provide. On a positive note, one area Rhode Island did see progress was <strong>financial efficiency and capacity</strong>: after takeover, the state negotiated a new funding settlement for Providence, ensuring the city contributes more stable funding to the schools (<a target="_blank" href="https://thepublicsradio.org/education/providence-finalizes-deal-with-state-over-funding-for-its-public-schools/#:~:text=Providence%20finalizes%20deal%20with%20state,the%20city%27s%20public%20school%20system">Providence finalizes deal with state over funding for its public schools</a>). This could, in time, translate to better resources in classrooms. But as of now, Rhode Island’s centrally managed efforts have yet to show the kind of academic turnaround policymakers hoped for. The lesson here is that turning funding and governance “switches” is just the beginning – the hard work of teaching and learning still must happen, and that takes time and additional strategies. Vermont, in implementing a new funding model, should also plan for how to support the effective use of those funds at the school level (professional development, curriculum enhancements, etc.), or else academic improvements might not materialize automatically.

                <strong>Mississippi:</strong> Mississippi has historically ranked at or near the bottom on many education indicators, but it offers an interesting study in contrasts recently. On one hand, Mississippi’s various district takeovers and consolidations – which are forms of centralization – have not yielded dramatic academic improvements in aggregate. Research and state audits have found that while takeovers can fix administrative problems or financial mismanagement, they <strong>“tend to improve administrative and financial practices but have less of an effect on classroom instruction,”</strong> leading to mixed academic results (<a target="_blank" href="http://hechingerreport.org/state-takeovers-fixing-mississippis-failing-districts/#:~:text=A%202004%20report%20from%20the,is%20usually%20mixed%2C%20the%20report">Are state takeovers fixing Mississippi’s failing districts?</a>). For example, the state took over the Hazlehurst City School District in 2008 due to academic and financial failure. After six years under state control, Hazlehurst did see some specific gains (as reported, its high school algebra proficiency jumped from 14% to 77% after the takeover) (<a target="_blank" href="http://hechingerreport.org/state-takeovers-fixing-mississippis-failing-districts/#:~:text=Nearly%20six%20years%20later%2C%20the,in%202008">Are state takeovers fixing Mississippi’s failing districts?</a>), but other scores remained very low and inconsistent (<a target="_blank" href="http://hechingerreport.org/state-takeovers-fixing-mississippis-failing-districts/#:~:text=advanced%20on%20the%20math%20exam%2C,in%202008">Are state takeovers fixing Mississippi’s failing districts?</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="http://hechingerreport.org/state-takeovers-fixing-mississippis-failing-districts/#:~:text=But%20some%20scores%20still%20linger,and%20student%20violence%20toward%20teachers">Are state takeovers fixing Mississippi’s failing districts?</a>). Once the state left, many improvements didn’t sustain, suggesting the changes hadn’t deeply taken root in teaching practice. Similarly, Mississippi merged three low-performing districts in the Delta (including Indianola) into one district with state oversight; the transition was rocky and student outcomes stayed stagnant for years. In 2021-2022, Mississippi’s <em>Achievement School District</em> (a state-run district for a few failing systems) actually received an “F” rating from the state – essentially, the state hadn’t yet succeeded in turning those schools around. On the other hand, Mississippi has recently gotten national attention for a targeted academic improvement: early literacy. In the mid-2010s, Mississippi implemented a <em>centralized initiative on reading instruction</em> (training teachers in the “science of reading,” screener assessments, and a 3rd grade reading gate). This was a state-driven program affecting all districts. The result was a notable rise in Grade 4 reading scores on NAEP – by 2019, Mississippi’s fourth-graders scored above the national average in reading, a remarkable jump (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=that%20fully%20funding%20education%20is,things%20that%20made%20them%20successful">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=work%20in%20improving%20literacy%20rates,things%20that%20made%20them%20successful">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>). This “Mississippi miracle” in reading shows that when the state centrally focuses on a specific academic strategy and backs it with resources and policy (in this case, coaching and curriculum standards), outcomes can improve. It’s a different type of centralization – not merging districts, but unifying instructional approach. The key takeaway from Mississippi is that <strong>centralization of structure (district mergers, state takeovers) alone didn’t boost learning much, but centralization of <em>effort and strategy</em> (like the literacy initiative) did make a difference </strong>. For Vermont, this suggests that simply reorganizing governance won’t automatically yield better test scores or graduation rates; it must be accompanied by well-chosen academic programs and capacity-building. Also, Mississippi’s consolidation plans carry a warning: a recent analysis pointed out that merging districts for efficiency often yields <em>“negligible or modest gains in academic performance”</em> at best (<a target="_blank" href="https://thebookchambersite.com/2025/01/31/educational-leadership-insights-mississippi-hb1431-and-the-complexity-of-consolidating-school-districts/#:~:text=educating%20students,modest%20gains%20in%20academic%20performance">Educational Leadership Insights: Mississippi HB1431 and the Complexity of Consolidating School Districts | The Book Chamber</a>). In some cases, students have actually been negatively impacted in the short term by the disruption of school closures and reassignments that come with consolidation (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.schoolstatus.com/blog/closures-and-consolidation-impact#:~:text=Closures%20%26%20Consolidation%3A%20Evidence%20of,negatively%20impacted%20by%20school%20closures">Closures &amp; Consolidation: Evidence of Impact and How Districts ...</a>). Those unintended consequences – lost extracurricular opportunities, longer commutes, community alienation – can offset hoped-for academic benefits.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Unintended Consequences:</strong> In all three states, ambitious reforms had side effects. When funding was centralized, some communities felt disempowered or less invested, which can dampen the community support that schools rely on. Large, centralized districts can also become bureaucratic; for example, if Vermont moves to just five districts, will each central office truly understand the needs of every far-flung town it serves? Mississippi’s push for countywide districts raised exactly that concern: that smaller or poorer communities in a new mega-district could lose out to more influential ones when all decisions are made by one county board (<a target="_blank" href="https://thebookchambersite.com/2025/01/31/educational-leadership-insights-mississippi-hb1431-and-the-complexity-of-consolidating-school-districts/#:~:text=community%20ties%20is%20not%20just,and%20that%20matters%20to%20people">Educational Leadership Insights: Mississippi HB1431 and the Complexity of Consolidating School Districts | The Book Chamber</a>). Additionally, school consolidation can lead to school closures in very small towns (to achieve “efficiency”), which may save money but often at the cost of students having to travel much further and families feeling their town has lost its heart. Such closures can hurt student involvement and performance if not handled carefully. Vermont, being rural in many parts, should be mindful of this; a centralized model must still find ways to <strong>preserve the accessibility of education</strong> for remote communities. Rhode Island’s experience suggests another possible consequence: when local accountability diminishes, there can be a sense of lost urgency. Some observers of the Providence takeover noted that with no elected local body in charge, it became harder for community members to know who to pressure for change – the lines of accountability blurred. Vermont will want to ensure that even with fewer school boards, the transparency and accountability to parents and voters remain strong.
              </p>
              <p>In sum, centralizing funding and governance is not a silver bullet for academic improvement. The formula needs to be <em>adequate</em> (enough funding to truly meet needs) and <em>strategic</em> (money well-spent on what research shows works). Massachusetts showed that when those conditions are met, student outcomes can indeed rise significantly (<a target="_blank" href="https://pioneerinstitute.org/common_core/how-massachusetts-showed-the-way-on-education-reform/#:~:text=Beginning%20in%201993%2C%20Massachusetts%E2%80%99%20SAT,administration%20of%20NAEP%20except%20one">How Massachusetts Showed the Way on Education Reform | School Choice</a>). Rhode Island and Mississippi show that if either of those conditions is missing – say, funding remains inadequate or reforms don’t penetrate the classroom – then outcomes may not budge much. Vermont’s proposed law explicitly references an evidence-based funding model aimed at “high-performing schools” and reducing performance gaps (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=by%20Allan%20Odden%20and%20Lawrence,Picus%20evaluated%20Vermont%20education%20spending">citation</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=and%20career,to%20those%20standards%20would%20substantially">citation</a>). This indicates Vermont’s awareness that money must align with proven educational strategies. The real test will be implementation: Will Vermont fully fund the formula each year? Will the new big districts use the funds to provide better instruction and student support, or will dollars get lost in a bigger bureaucracy? Those execution details will determine whether Vermont sees the kind of academic gains Massachusetts achieved or faces the disappointments that Rhode Island and Mississippi encountered in some of their efforts. </p>
              <h2 id="key-lessons-for-vermont">Key Lessons for Vermont</h2>
              <p>Drawing on these case studies, several key lessons emerge for Vermont as it considers moving forward with education transformation:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Ensure Funding Equity <em>and</em> Adequacy: </strong> Centralizing the funding system can indeed reduce inequities – e.g., Rhode Island’s formula began to close wealth-based gaps (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/new-r-i-school-funding-formula-aims-at-equity/2010/07#:~:text=For%20years%2C%20the%20state%E2%80%99s%20districts,student%20in%20more%20affluent%20communities">New R.I. School Funding Formula Aims at Equity</a>) and Massachusetts’ investment drove statewide improvements (<a target="_blank" href="https://pioneerinstitute.org/common_core/how-massachusetts-showed-the-way-on-education-reform/#:~:text=Beginning%20in%201993%2C%20Massachusetts%E2%80%99%20SAT,administration%20of%20NAEP%20except%20one">How Massachusetts Showed the Way on Education Reform | School Choice</a>). Vermont should follow through on the proposed weighted foundation formula (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=bill%20also%20proposes%20to%20transform,education%20financing%20system%20to%20a">citation</a>) by fully funding it and regularly updating it for inflation and student needs. Mississippi’s experience shows that a formula on paper means little if the legislature underfunds it (as seen with MAEP shortfalls of \$100+ million (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CA%20lot%20of%20those%20programs,%E2%80%9D">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>)). Vermont must avoid gaps between promised and actual funding, or poorer districts will remain behind.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Balance Central Authority with Local Voice:</strong> Eliminating dozens of local school boards in favor of five regional ones is a dramatic shift. To prevent community alienation, Vermont should build in avenues for local input – for instance, advisory councils at the town or school level within each large district. Mississippi’s push for countywide districts raised fears of losing “community ties that often fuel educational success” (<a target="_blank" href="https://thebookchambersite.com/2025/01/31/educational-leadership-insights-mississippi-hb1431-and-the-complexity-of-consolidating-school-districts/#:~:text=each%20with%20unique%20needs%20and,cutter%E2%80%9D%20approach">Educational Leadership Insights: Mississippi HB1431 and the Complexity of Consolidating School Districts | The Book Chamber</a>). Vermont can mitigate this by keeping schools connected to their communities (through local school councils, regular public forums, or representation from each area on the new district boards). Keeping the public engaged will help sustain support for the reforms.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Implement Changes Gradually and Transparently:</strong> Major reorganization can be disruptive. Clear transition plans and timelines (like Rhode Island mapping goals to return Providence to local control (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2025/02/providence-schools-could-return-to-local-control-by-summer-2026-state-leaders-say#:~:text=RIDE%E2%80%99s%20framework%20for%20ending%20the,school%20board%20and%20transition%20planning">Providence schools could return to local control by summer 2026, state leaders say - The Brown Daily Herald</a>)) help set expectations. Vermont should phase in the new system in a way that avoids chaos – for example, aligning budgeting cycles, slowly merging administrative functions, and communicating how decisions will be made. Transparency in how the new districts allocate resources will be crucial to gain trust, especially from towns that fear they may pay in but not see benefits.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Guard Against “Separate but Unequal” Systems:</strong> Vermont’s small expansion of school choice options must be monitored so it doesn’t inadvertently create a two-tier system. Mississippi’s history of vouchers aiding segregation academies is a warning (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=The%20fight%20over%20vouchers%20stretches,remain%20mostly%20white%20and%20receive">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/school-funding-reform-school-choice-bills-among-lawmakers-plans/#:~:text=Loome%20is%20concerned%20about%20the,the%20funds%20for%20voucher%20programs">School Funding Reform, ‘School Choice’ Among Lawmakers’ Plans</a>). Vermont should ensure any public funds used for independent schools (through its “School Choice School” designations) go only to schools that meet public standards and serve all types of students (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=A%20school%20board%20shall%20designate,one%20public%20or%20independent%20school">citation</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=schools,by%20the%20district%20is%20an">citation</a>). Likewise, if students transfer between public schools, the rules should prevent excessive “brain drain” from one school to another. The goal is to increase options without undermining equity.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Link Funding Reforms to Academic Strategies:</strong> Money alone won’t boost learning. Massachusetts tied its funding surge to high standards, accountability, and instructional improvements – and saw results (<a target="_blank" href="https://pioneerinstitute.org/common_core/how-massachusetts-showed-the-way-on-education-reform/#:~:text=Beginning%20in%201993%2C%20Massachusetts%E2%80%99%20SAT,administration%20of%20NAEP%20except%20one">How Massachusetts Showed the Way on Education Reform | School Choice</a>). Vermont has identified an evidence-based spending model (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=,Based">citation</a>); now it should also invest in teacher training, curriculum, and interventions (like early literacy programs, tutoring, etc.) that make the most of that funding. Mississippi’s leap in reading scores shows the power of focusing on a specific academic initiative at the state level. Vermont should similarly identify key outcome areas (literacy, math, graduation rates) and drive resources into proven programs for those. Regular evaluation and adjustment of strategies will keep the reform focused on student results, not just new bureaucracy.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Monitor and Address Unintended Consequences:</strong> After implementation, Vermont should closely watch for any negative side effects. For example, if the new funding formula inadvertently harms small schools (perhaps the “school scale” weight (<a target="_blank" href="draft-proposal-4.1.txt#:~:text=year%202025%2C%20with%20additional%20weights,student%20need%2C%20school%20scale%2C%20and">citation</a>) isn’t enough), be ready to adjust it. If certain student groups or regions still lag, consider additional supports or policy tweaks. In Mississippi, consolidations sometimes led to school closures that hurt communities (<a target="_blank" href="https://thebookchambersite.com/2025/01/31/educational-leadership-insights-mississippi-hb1431-and-the-complexity-of-consolidating-school-districts/#:~:text=Another%20concern%20is%20the%20disruption,31%20Other">Educational Leadership Insights: Mississippi HB1431 and the Complexity of Consolidating School Districts | The Book Chamber</a>); Vermont can decide upfront how to handle small, rural schools – maybe by offering them extra support or alternatives to closure (such as becoming community centers or adopting multi-grade classrooms) to maintain presence in each town. Essentially, continuous feedback and willingness to refine the law will be important.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Maintain Accountability and Public Engagement:</strong> With more centralized control, it’s vital to keep the system accountable to the people. Massachusetts benefited from transparent reporting (state test scores, school report cards) that allowed the public to see progress and problems. Vermont should do the same, reporting outcomes for each of the five new districts and each school, to ensure that inequities within districts are identified and addressed. Encourage community involvement in setting goals for the new districts. Rhode Island’s lesson is that if people feel shut out (as some did in Providence under state management), trust erodes. Vermont should proactively include parents, educators, and students in the continuous improvement process of this transformation.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>In conclusion, Vermont stands at a pivotal moment with its proposed education transformation. The experiences of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Mississippi offer a roadmap of what to emulate and what to avoid. <strong>Bold funding reform and district reorganization can lead to more equitable and excellent education, but only if executed with care</strong>. Vermont can take heart in Massachusetts’ success, strive to avoid Rhode Island’s frustrations, and be ever mindful of Mississippi’s cautionary tales. By learning from these states – prioritizing equity, keeping communities involved, and focusing relentlessly on student learning – Vermont can increase the chances that its ambitious overhaul delivers on its promise of a better education for every student in every corner of the state.
