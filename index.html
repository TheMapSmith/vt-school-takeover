        <h1>Vermont Education Reform Analysis</h1>
        <p>I will provide a revised critical analysis of Vermont’s education reform proposal, focusing on how it could exacerbate racial and economic inequities by shifting funding away from diverse, underfunded schools and the dangers of centralization if driven by wealthier political interests to undo fair funding reforms.</p>
        <p>I will assess the proposal in light of these risks and compare it with historical examples where centralization and school choice policies have worsened inequities. This will include highlighting potential harms to vulnerable communities and the risk of dismantling public education in favor of wealthier interests.</p>
        <p>Expect a detailed critique soon.</p>

        <h2 id="reversal-of-funding-equity-gains">Reversal of Funding Equity Gains</h2>
        <p>Vermont has made significant strides in equitable school funding since the landmark <em>Brigham v. Vermont</em> case (1997) led to a statewide funding system balancing resources between property-rich and property-poor districts. The new proposal to centralize funding under a “foundation formula” threatens to undermine these gains. It would set a base per-student amount and allow some districts to raise additional local funds above that base (<a href="https://www.chestertelegraph.org/2025/02/19/side-by-side-we-compare-two-education-plans-from-the-scott-administration/#:~:text=,evaluate%20school%20funding">Side by Side: Scott education plans past and present | The Chester Telegraph</a>). This resembles the pre-<em>Brigham</em> funding model that let affluent communities spend far more on their schools than poorer ones – a disparity the Vermont Supreme Court found unconstitutional (<a href="https://www.chestertelegraph.org/2025/02/19/side-by-side-we-compare-two-education-plans-from-the-scott-administration/#:~:text=,evaluate%20school%20funding">Side by Side: Scott education plans past and present | The Chester Telegraph</a>). By pooling less of the education budget statewide, the reform could shift resources away from high-need, underfunded schools and back toward wealthier areas.</p>
        <p>Under the current system (and recently adopted weighting reforms), Vermont directs extra funds to districts with greater needs – such as those with higher poverty, English learners, or rural isolation. Centralizing budgets at the state level might seem to preserve equity by distributing foundation grants with need-based adjustments (<a href="https://www.vermontpublic.org/local-news/2025-01-22/state-officials-unveil-gov-scotts-education-reform-ideas#:~:text=The%20cornerstone%20of%20Scott%E2%80%99s%20reform,need%20students">State officials unveil Gov.

Scott&#39;s education reform ideas | Vermont Public</a>). <strong>However, the crucial difference is local add-ons:</strong> Governor Scott’s plan would let communities spend above the state grant if they raise the money themselves (<a href="https://www.vermontpublic.org/local-news/2025-01-22/state-officials-unveil-gov-scotts-education-reform-ideas#:~:text=explainer%20and%20glossary%20of%20terms">State officials unveil Gov. Scott&#39;s education reform ideas | Vermont Public</a>). Even if capped, this opens the door to inequity. Wealthier districts could leverage their larger tax bases to supplement budgets, recreating the funding gaps Vermont worked to close. As the <em>Chester Telegraph</em> noted, the proposal is <strong>“similar to the one that was struck down by the Vermont Supreme Court in the Brigham case,”</strong> which had found that richer districts’ ability to spend more per pupil violated constitutional guarantees of equity (<a href="https://www.chestertelegraph.org/2025/02/19/side-by-side-we-compare-two-education-plans-from-the-scott-administration/#:~:text=,evaluate%20school%20funding">Side by Side: Scott education plans past and present | The Chester Telegraph</a>). In short, the reform risks reversing Vermont’s hard-won funding fairness by once again tying educational quality to local wealth.</p>
        <p>Other states offer cautionary tales. Pennsylvania, for example, implemented a fair funding formula in 2016, but political compromises (like holding districts harmless for prior allocations) allowed affluent communities to maintain advantages. As of 2020, Pennsylvania’s 100 wealthiest districts still spent <strong>48% more per student</strong> (adjusted for need) than the 100 poorest districts – state aid wasn’t enough to level the field (<a href="https://www.houseappropriations.com/files/Documents/BEF_Primer_102820.pdf#:~:text=SDs%20educate%2027,funding%20where%20huge%20disparities%20exist"></a>) (<a href="https://www.houseappropriations.com/files/Documents/BEF_Primer_102820.pdf#:~:text=Nevertheless%2C%20inequities%20persist,If"></a>). This shows how quickly equity gains erode if wealthier areas assert their influence over funding policies. Vermont risks a similar backslide: if the foundation grant is too low or local add-ons too permissive, under-resourced schools (often serving more low-income and minority students) could end up with <strong>less</strong> funding and larger inequities than under the current model. Such an outcome would defeat the very purpose of Vermont’s recent reforms to <strong>“balance resources between wealthy and disadvantaged districts.”</strong></p>
        <h2 id="wealthy-districts-regaining-power">Wealthy Districts Regaining Power</h2>
        <p>Critics worry that behind the push for centralization is a desire by wealthier (and often predominantly white) districts to reclaim power over school funding. In Vermont, affluent communities have long contributed significant tax revenues to the statewide Education Fund, effectively subsidizing less wealthy districts – a design intended to ensure equity. The new plan could appease wealthier areas by letting them keep more of their money for their own schools, diluting the redistributive nature of the current system. The Vermont School Boards Association directly cautioned that Governor Scott’s proposal appears to be <strong>“a playbook to expanding school vouchers and defunding our public schools,”</strong> rather than strengthening the public system (<a href="https://muckrack.com/sue-ceglowski#:~:text=Submitted%20by%20tim%20on%20Tue%2C,and%20defunding%20our%20public%20schools">Sue Ceglowski’s Profile | Vermont Business Magazine Journalist | Muck Rack</a>). This hints that well-resourced interests are leveraging the rhetoric of “efficiency” to roll back the equitable funding structure in favor of one that benefits themselves.</p>
        <p>We have seen similar patterns elsewhere. In <strong>Washington State</strong>, for example, legislators faced pressure from property-rich districts to lift caps on local school levies that had been imposed to comply with the <em>McCleary</em> school funding equity ruling. An editorial in <em>The Columbian</em> warned that raising the levy lid was <strong>“a step backward for school funding”</strong> – inviting a return to the <strong>inequitable funding</strong> that the court had tried to fix (<a href="https://www.columbian.com/news/2019/apr/11/in-our-view-lifting-levy-lid-violates-spirit-of-mccleary-deal/#:~:text=Efforts%20in%20the%20Legislature%20to,fought%20agreement">In Our View: Lifting levy lid violates spirit of McCleary deal - The Columbian</a>). That warning came true when the cap was loosened: wealthy districts like Seattle could suddenly generate millions more in local revenue, widening gaps again and undermining the state’s promise of equal educational opportunity. Wealthy districts often fight to preserve their advantages; if Vermont centralizes control without strong equity safeguards, those with political clout could lobby for formulas that favor higher-income regions or allow loopholes (like special grants or lower tax rates) benefiting themselves.</p>
        <p>Another strategy affluent communities use is <strong>district secession</strong> or special carve-outs. Across the country, predominantly white, wealthier enclaves have broken away from larger, more diverse school systems to hoard their tax dollars – from Alabama to Tennessee, this has exacerbated racial and economic segregation. While Vermont’s proposal isn’t a secession, creating just five mega-districts could give outsized voice to wealthier pockets within each region to influence resource distribution. History shows that when the balance of power shifts upward (to state or regional bodies), well-organized privileged groups often dominate decision-making. In <strong>Pennsylvania</strong>, prior to its funding reforms, a “hold harmless” policy (kept in place by lawmakers from shrinking, higher-income districts) meant affluent, low-need districts continued receiving excessive state aid even as poorer urban districts struggled. Funding increases for already well-funded suburban schools grew <strong>three times faster</strong> than for growing high-need districts, entrenching inequality (<a href="https://whyy.org/articles/advocates-highlight-how-pa-s-outdated-school-funding-policy-causes-deep-inequities/#:~:text=Advocates%20highlight%20inequities%20in%20Pa,the%20ones%20gaining%20students">Advocates highlight inequities in Pa. school funding - WHYY</a>). This was a deliberate outcome of political influence, not accident. Vermont must be wary that a centralized system, if designed or later tweaked under pressure from wealthier districts, could <strong>restore disproportionate allocations to privileged schools</strong> – effectively undoing decades of fairness efforts.</p>
        <h2 id="dangers-of-state-led-centralization">Dangers of State-Led Centralization</h2>
        <p>Shifting school governance from local elected boards to centralized state control carries serious risks, especially for diverse and low-income communities. Proponents argue that Vermont’s plan to consolidate into five state-run districts will streamline operations and raise quality. But examples from Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Mississippi illustrate how state-led takeovers and heavily centralized systems can disempower local communities and often fail to deliver promised improvements.</p>
        <p><strong>Rhode Island’s</strong> experience with Providence Public Schools is a cautionary tale. In 2019, after a scathing report on school conditions, the state seized control of Providence’s schools. Years later, local officials and residents remain frustrated by their lack of voice. The state extended its takeover for at least three more years in 2024, against the wishes of Providence’s mayor, city council, and school board (<a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2024/09/providence-public-schools-state-takeover-continues-despite-local-objections#:~:text=After%20five%20years%20under%20state,making%20power%20over%20itself">Providence Public Schools’ state takeover continues despite local objections - The Brown Daily Herald</a>) (<a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2024/09/providence-public-schools-state-takeover-continues-despite-local-objections#:~:text=But%20last%20month%2C%20a%20state,RIDE%2C%20for%20three%20more%20years">Providence Public Schools’ state takeover continues despite local objections - The Brown Daily Herald</a>). Under the takeover, the state education commissioner wields “near total power over district decisions” (<a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2024/09/providence-public-schools-state-takeover-continues-despite-local-objections#:~:text=Since%20the%20PPSD%20first%20came,PPSD%20by%20Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Providence Public Schools’ state takeover continues despite local objections - The Brown Daily Herald</a>). The appointed Providence School Board can do little more than advise – it <strong>unanimously voted to end the state intervention, but “the vote has no power to override” the state’s decision</strong> (<a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2024/09/providence-public-schools-state-takeover-continues-despite-local-objections#:~:text=transition%20back%20to%20local%20control,26%20school%20year">Providence Public Schools’ state takeover continues despite local objections - The Brown Daily Herald</a>). This loss of democratic control has left families and students feeling alienated. As one community leader put it, the takeover created <em>“a disorganized and messy organization attempting to manage a disorganized and messy organization”</em>, with no clear gains for students (<a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2024/09/providence-public-schools-state-takeover-continues-despite-local-objections#:~:text=Providence%20Student%20Union%20Executive%20Director,%E2%80%9D">Providence Public Schools’ state takeover continues despite local objections - The Brown Daily Herald</a>). Even student and parent engagement has suffered: <strong>“there currently aren’t any tangible pipelines for students to give feedback”</strong> under state management, and public forums have strict limits on community input (<a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2024/09/providence-public-schools-state-takeover-continues-despite-local-objections#:~:text=better%20community%20engagement,%E2%80%9D">Providence Public Schools’ state takeover continues despite local objections - The Brown Daily Herald</a>). Providence’s example shows that state centralization often sidelines the very people the schools serve. Despite some managerial changes, the <strong>“persistent challenges”</strong> remain, and the locals most invested in the schools have been largely shut out of decision-making.</p>
        <p><strong>Massachusetts</strong> has similarly turned to state receivership in districts serving mostly low-income students of color – with mixed results and community pushback. The city of Lawrence (over 90% Latino and low-income) was taken over by a state-appointed receiver in 2011. A decade later, a former state board member bluntly assessed the outcome: <strong>“A decade of management by a state-appointed receiver has brought Lawrence families no closer to the schools they deserve. Lawrence ranks 16th from the bottom of all Massachusetts districts.”</strong> (<a href="https://baystatebanner.com/2022/04/21/where-is-the-track-record-for-receivership/#:~:text=I%20was%20wrong">Where is the track record for receivership? – The Bay State Banner</a>) The promised academic “transformation” never materialized even with complete state control. Instead, the state’s approach often relied on strict accountability measures like test scores and reconstituting staff – strategies that destabilized schools without addressing root causes of inequity. At one elementary school under receivership, nearly <strong>100% of teachers were forced to reapply for their jobs, leading to almost complete turnover</strong> and a drop in enrollment (<a href="https://baystatebanner.com/2022/04/21/where-is-the-track-record-for-receivership/#:~:text=schools%3F%20Since%202010%2C%20the%20state,8th%20percentile%20on%20test%20scores">Where is the track record for receivership? – The Bay State Banner</a>). After years of top-down control, that school remains in the bottom percentile statewide (<a href="https://baystatebanner.com/2022/04/21/where-is-the-track-record-for-receivership/#:~:text=schools%3F%20Since%202010%2C%20the%20state,8th%20percentile%20on%20test%20scores">Where is the track record for receivership? – The Bay State Banner</a>). The broader pattern in Massachusetts is telling: since empowering state takeovers in 2010, dozens of schools have been labeled “underperforming,” but only <strong>2 out of 65</strong> exited that status and rose above the bottom half in performance (<a href="https://baystatebanner.com/2022/04/21/where-is-the-track-record-for-receivership/#:~:text=label%20is%20based%20on%20MCAS,students%20especially%20vulnerable%20to%20takeover">Where is the track record for receivership? – The Bay State Banner</a>). In other words, centralized state interventions have a poor track record, often treating symptoms (low test scores) while ignoring underlying issues like poverty – which one official noted <em>“makes districts with many high-needs students especially vulnerable to takeover”</em> (<a href="https://baystatebanner.com/2022/04/21/where-is-the-track-record-for-receivership/#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cchronically%20underperforming%E2%80%9D%20schools%20than%20ever,before">Where is the track record for receivership? – The Bay State Banner</a>). Crucially, these takeovers strip communities of self-governance. In Holyoke, MA (another poorer, majority-Latino district under state receivership), local elected school committees lost authority, prompting resistance from residents who felt their voices were erased. Even in Boston, when state officials floated a partial takeover of the city’s schools in 2022, community outrage and the mayor’s opposition forced a retreat to a collaborative (non-receivership) improvement plan (<a href="https://baystatebanner.com/2022/06/29/wu-reaches-deal-averts-receivership/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99re%20ready%20for%20the%20work,%E2%80%9D">Wu reaches deal, averts receivership – The Bay State Banner</a>). The common theme: state-led centralization tends to target marginalized communities, remove local democratic input, and often fails to substantially improve outcomes – all while breeding mistrust.</p>
        <p><strong>Mississippi</strong> provides a stark example of how far-reaching and antidemocratic state control can become. State law there allows takeovers through a “District of Transformation” model in which local school boards are dissolved and the state board of education becomes the governing body (<a href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/two-ways-to-take-over-a-school-district/#:~:text=Last%20month%2C%20the%20Mississippi%20Board,interim%20superintendent%20to%20take%20control">Two Ways to Take Over a School District - Mississippi Free Press</a>) (<a href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/two-ways-to-take-over-a-school-district/#:~:text=list,interim%20superintendent%20to%20take%20control">Two Ways to Take Over a School District - Mississippi Free Press</a>). Once a district is taken over, the new rules mandate <strong>at least an eight-year period</strong> of state governance – <em>“an entire generation of students may not fully know the benefits of having their parents and local citizens as the controlling voices of their school culture,”</em> as a coalition in Jackson, MS warned (<a href="https://themississippilink.com/education/let-jackson-govern-its-public-schools/#:~:text=about%20its%20implications">Let Jackson Govern  Its Public Schools – The Mississippi Link</a>) (<a href="https://themississippilink.com/education/let-jackson-govern-its-public-schools/#:~:text=A%20new%20law%20which%20took,voices%20of%20their%20school%20culture">Let Jackson Govern  Its Public Schools – The Mississippi Link</a>). In practice, this meant community members in majority-Black Jackson feared losing any say in their children’s education throughout their K-12 years. The concerns were not just theoretical: under state control, local traditions and programs can be upended. Takeovers have led to neighborhood schools being closed or merged into far-off campuses, denying students the familiar support systems of their communities (<a href="https://themississippilink.com/education/let-jackson-govern-its-public-schools/#:~:text=Tragically%2C%20these%20students%20may%20arbitrarily,state%20institutions">Let Jackson Govern  Its Public Schools – The Mississippi Link</a>). Parents in Jackson also raised alarms that students could even face hurdles getting their diplomas recognized, due to turmoil and stigmas associated with being in a “taken over” district (<a href="https://themississippilink.com/education/let-jackson-govern-its-public-schools/#:~:text=experiences%20that%20come%20with%20competing,state%20institutions">Let Jackson Govern  Its Public Schools – The Mississippi Link</a>). Such drastic centralization feels to residents more like punishment than help. The public outcry in Mississippi was loud, with parents, educators, faith and business leaders uniting under the banner <strong>#OurJPS</strong> to demand local control and call out the state’s overreach (<a href="https://themississippilink.com/education/let-jackson-govern-its-public-schools/#:~:text=We%20believe%20the%20children%20of,to%20make%20their%20concerns%20known">Let Jackson Govern  Its Public Schools – The Mississippi Link</a>). This pressure ultimately helped avert an immediate takeover of Jackson’s schools in 2018, demonstrating the depth of local resistance to disenfranchisement (<a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2017/10/26/gov-bryant-orders-independent-review-of-jackson-public-schools/#:~:text=...%20mississippitoday.org%20%20A%20self,state%27s%20second%20largest%20school">Jackson Public Schools avoid takeover; Gov. Bryant orders ...</a>). Still, Mississippi’s laws remain in place, and several smaller, predominantly African-American districts have been absorbed into the state-run Achievement School District – often with disappointing results academically and a loss of community identity.</p>
        <p>The lessons from these states are clear. <strong>Centralization driven by state officials often disempowers the very communities that most need support</strong>, and it tends to be communities of color and high poverty that are targeted. While Vermont’s proposal is not a punitive “takeover” of a failing district, it similarly recentralizes key decisions – from budgeting to curriculum to school closures – in the hands of state authorities (<a href="https://www.vermontpublic.org/local-news/2025-01-22/state-officials-unveil-gov-scotts-education-reform-ideas#:~:text=the%20Statehouse%20in%20Montpelier%20on,March%2022%2C%202024">State officials unveil Gov.

Scott&#39;s education reform ideas | Vermont Public</a>). The plan would eliminate most local school boards and instead have a single board for each of the five new regions (<a href="https://www.vermontpublic.org/local-news/2025-01-22/state-officials-unveil-gov-scotts-education-reform-ideas#:~:text=The%20state%E2%80%99s%20119%20districts%20would,power%20these%20panels%20would%20retain">State officials unveil Gov.

Scott&#39;s education reform ideas | Vermont Public</a>). If Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Mississippi show what happens when the state calls all the shots, Vermont stands to see <strong>diminished local accountability</strong> and policies that may not reflect unique community needs. Diverse, under-resourced communities could especially lose out if their voices are drowned in a top-down system. Vermont’s own rural education leaders have expressed that the plan is so sweeping and “imperfectly informed” that it would only <strong>“exacerbate an ever-growing reality in Vermont”</strong> – namely, inequity and rural decline (<a href="https://vermontdailychronicle.com/nek-educators-accuse-guv-of-finger-wagging/#:~:text=VREC%20says%20the%20governor%E2%80%99s%20plan,is%20unrealistic">NEK educators accuse guv of ‘finger wagging,’ and worse - Vermont Daily Chronicle</a>). In sum, concentrating power at the state level might simplify governance on paper, but it risks disenfranchising communities and repeating other states’ mistakes where centralization did more harm than good.</p>
        <h2 id="school-privatization-and-public-school-erosion">School Privatization and Public School Erosion</h2>
        <p>Another major concern is that Vermont’s reform could open the door to school privatization – funneling public dollars to private and religious schools – which in other states has worsened segregation and weakened the public education system. Notably, the Governor’s <strong>“Stronger Schools, Stronger Students”</strong> plan includes a provision for school choice that goes beyond public school choice: <strong>it would let students take public funds to attend private schools via a lottery</strong> (<a href="https://www.chestertelegraph.org/2025/02/19/side-by-side-we-compare-two-education-plans-from-the-scott-administration/#:~:text=School%20Choice">Side by Side: Scott education plans past and present | The Chester Telegraph</a>). This is essentially a voucher program in disguise. Education Secretary Zoie Saunders, coming from Florida, has emphasized “choice,” and Vermont’s plan mirrors the <strong>Florida-style voucher expansion</strong>, where public funding follows students out of the public schools. Vermont’s school boards association has warned that the proposal is intended to <strong>expand vouchers</strong> at the expense of public schools (<a href="https://muckrack.com/sue-ceglowski#:~:text=Submitted%20by%20tim%20on%20Tue%2C,and%20defunding%20our%20public%20schools">Sue Ceglowski’s Profile | Vermont Business Magazine Journalist | Muck Rack</a>). If implemented, Vermont would shift from a system where public funds are invested in public schools serving all children, to one where taxpayer money can subsidize private education for a few – with far less oversight.</p>
        <p>Florida’s recent experience provides a stark warning. In 2023, Florida’s legislature expanded vouchers to virtually all students, making it the nation’s biggest “school choice” laboratory (<a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/florida-just-became-the-nations-biggest-school-choice-laboratory/#:~:text=Florida%20Just%20Became%20the%20Nation%27s,voucher%20or%20education%20savings%20account">Florida Just Became the Nation&#39;s Biggest School Choice Laboratory</a>). The result has been an enormous diversion of funds from public schools. By the 2024-25 school year, Florida expects to spend <strong>$3.9 billion in state funds on private education vouchers</strong>, up from about $2.2 billion just a year prior (<a href="https://www.floridapolicy.org/posts/florida-continues-to-drain-much-needed-funds-away-from-public-schools-to-private-and-home-school-students#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20Florida%20passed%20HB,the%20Florida%20Tax%20Credit%20Scholarship">Florida Continues to Drain Much-Needed Funds Away from Public Schools to Private and Home-School Students</a>) (<a href="https://www.floridapolicy.org/posts/florida-continues-to-drain-much-needed-funds-away-from-public-schools-to-private-and-home-school-students#:~:text=For%20FY%202024,is%20supporting%20public%20schools%20in">Florida Continues to Drain Much-Needed Funds Away from Public Schools to Private and Home-School Students</a>). <strong>Only 77% of Florida’s state education dollars now go to public schools, down from 88% two years earlier</strong> (<a href="https://www.floridapolicy.org/posts/florida-continues-to-drain-much-needed-funds-away-from-public-schools-to-private-and-home-school-students#:~:text=same%20time%2C%20the%20amount%20of,in%20the%20past%20four%20years">Florida Continues to Drain Much-Needed Funds Away from Public Schools to Private and Home-School Students</a>). This rapid siphoning of public money has left many Florida public school districts scrambling. Every dollar that goes to a private or religious academy is a dollar not available for public school teacher salaries, support staff, facility improvements, or programs for the remaining students. Yet these private institutions are not subject to the same accountability: Florida’s voucher-funded schools face minimal state oversight on academic standards, financial reporting, or civil rights protections (<a href="https://www.floridapolicy.org/posts/florida-continues-to-drain-much-needed-funds-away-from-public-schools-to-private-and-home-school-students#:~:text=There%20will%20be%20continued%20growth,8">Florida Continues to Drain Much-Needed Funds Away from Public Schools to Private and Home-School Students</a>). Indeed, a 2020 investigation found that <strong>over $100 million in Florida voucher funds went to private schools with explicit anti-LGBTQ policies</strong> and other forms of discrimination (<a href="https://firstfocus.org/resource/school-vouchers-issue-brief/#:~:text=Private%20schools%20regularly%20discriminate%20against,schools%20in%20Florida%20that%20have">School Vouchers and the growing threat to public education  | First Focus on Children</a>). Public funds are subsidizing exclusionary practices, which would be illegal in any public school. Vermonters alarmed by this note that our state would be similarly <strong>“paying funding directly to private schools”</strong> for certain grades under the new plan (<a href="https://muckrack.com/sue-ceglowski#:~:text=Submitted%20by%20tim%20on%20Tue%2C,and%20defunding%20our%20public%20schools">Sue Ceglowski’s Profile | Vermont Business Magazine Journalist | Muck Rack</a>).</p>
        <p>Beyond the financial drain, voucher schemes tend to exacerbate segregation by race and class. The historical precedent is well-documented: after <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, segregation academies sprang up across the South, and white families fled integrated public schools, often using publicly funded tuition grants to do so (<a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2024/school-choice-and-a-history-of-segregation-collide-as-one-florida-county-shutters-its-rural-schools/#:~:text=As%20a%20new%20wave%20of,in%20mostly%20white%20private%20schools">School choice and a history of segregation collide as one Florida county shutters its rural schools | The Associated Press</a>). Modern vouchers risk reviving that pattern. Research indicates that <strong>“school vouchers have been much more successful at segregating schools by class and race”</strong>, rather than improving overall achievement (<a href="https://firstfocus.org/resource/school-vouchers-issue-brief/#:~:text=Instead%2C%20school%20vouchers%20have%20been,access%20to%20education%20for%20LGBTQ">School Vouchers and the growing threat to public education  | First Focus on Children</a>). Early studies from states like Louisiana, Ohio, and Indiana suggest vouchers lead to increased stratification – with higher-income families more likely to use them, and many voucher recipients were already in private schools before (meaning the program is just subsidizing those who could often afford private tuition anyway) (<a href="https://firstfocus.org/resource/school-vouchers-issue-brief/#:~:text=Instead%2C%20school%20vouchers%20have%20been,access%20to%20education%20for%20LGBTQ">School Vouchers and the growing threat to public education  | First Focus on Children</a>). In Florida’s case, reporters have observed white flight dynamics at play: in some rural counties, as soon as public schools began consolidating (due to enrollment losses from charter and voucher programs), white parents openly said they’d rather <strong>use vouchers or homeschool than send their kids to a consolidated, more diverse public school</strong> (<a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2024/school-choice-and-a-history-of-segregation-collide-as-one-florida-county-shutters-its-rural-schools/#:~:text=Payne%20delved%20into%20this%20by,that%20is%20currently%20predominately%20Black">School choice and a history of segregation collide as one Florida county shutters its rural schools | The Associated Press</a>) (<a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2024/school-choice-and-a-history-of-segregation-collide-as-one-florida-county-shutters-its-rural-schools/#:~:text=Payne%20visited%20the%20elementary%20schools,race%20kids">School choice and a history of segregation collide as one Florida county shutters its rural schools | The Associated Press</a>). The outcome is <em>de facto</em> segregation – public schools left with higher concentrations of low-income, minority, and special-needs students, and fewer resources to serve them, while voucher-supported private schools cater to more advantaged populations. Vermont, which has relatively high-performing public schools, could see a similar erosion: small public schools, especially in rural and high-poverty areas, might lose students (and funding) to private options, only to find those private schools unequipped or unwilling to serve all children. Over time, this <strong>hollows out the public system</strong>, leaving a residual of higher-need students with less political support to fund their education. As one national analysis put it, <strong>vouchers strip critical funding from rural and small-town public schools – often forcing teacher layoffs, cutting extracurriculars, or even causing school closures</strong> in those communities (<a href="https://firstfocus.org/resource/school-vouchers-issue-brief/#:~:text=attend,programs%2C%20and%20even%20school%20closures">School Vouchers and the growing threat to public education  | First Focus on Children</a>). This is deeply concerning for Vermont’s many rural towns, where the public school is not just an educational institution but the heart of the community.</p>
        <p>It’s also important to note that numerous studies have found <strong>no clear academic benefit from voucher programs</strong>, and in some cases negative effects on student learning. States like Indiana and Louisiana saw voucher students perform worse on standardized tests than their public school peers in the first few years. What vouchers undeniably do is undermine the financial viability of public schools. They embody a shift from viewing education as a public good for society to a consumer good for individual families – a philosophy at odds with Vermont’s tradition of town-supported schools open to all. If Vermont were to adopt a Florida-style approach, we could expect: a flow of public money to sectarian religious schools (raising church-state issues), increased segregation (by enabling enclaves of privilege), and a two-tier education system. Those who can navigate the voucher system or add their own money will get one tier, and those left in the public system, which has been <strong>“starved of resources”</strong> (<a href="https://firstfocus.org/resource/school-vouchers-issue-brief/#:~:text=PUBLIC%20SCHOOLS%20AREN%E2%80%99T%20FAILING%2C%20THEY%E2%80%99RE,STARVING">School Vouchers and the growing threat to public education  | First Focus on Children</a>) (<a href="https://firstfocus.org/resource/school-vouchers-issue-brief/#:~:text=This%20chronic%20underfunding%20is%20especially,the%20hardest%20by%20economic%20downturns">School Vouchers and the growing threat to public education  | First Focus on Children</a>), will get the other. <strong>This is precisely what VSBA’s director cautioned against</strong> – that the reform would <strong>defund public schools under the guise of ‘choice’ (<a href="https://muckrack.com/sue-ceglowski#:~:text=Submitted%20by%20tim%20on%20Tue%2C,and%20defunding%20our%20public%20schools">Sue Ceglowski’s Profile | Vermont Business Magazine Journalist | Muck Rack</a>).</strong> Vermont should heed the evidence and avoid policies that dismantle the very foundation of a fair, integrated public education system.</p>
        <h2 id="community-and-advocacy-opposition">Community and Advocacy Opposition</h2>
        <p>The pushback against the proposed overhaul has been swift and broad-based. Vermont’s local school leaders, educators, and advocates recognize what’s at stake: the equity and democratic control that define our public schools. They are drawing on historical lessons and experiences from other states to oppose changes that could harm Vermont’s students.</p>
        <p><strong>Local School Officials’ Response:</strong> The Vermont School Boards Association (VSBA) and Vermont Superintendents Association have come out strongly against the centralization plan. In a public response, VSBA’s Executive Director Sue Ceglowski argued that rather than supporting “an ecosystem built on strong public schools,” the governor’s plan would undermine that ecosystem (<a href="https://muckrack.com/sue-ceglowski#:~:text=Submitted%20by%20tim%20on%20Tue%2C,and%20defunding%20our%20public%20schools">Sue Ceglowski’s Profile | Vermont Business Magazine Journalist | Muck Rack</a>). She noted it reads like a blueprint for diverting funds to private vouchers and weakening public schools (<a href="https://muckrack.com/sue-ceglowski#:~:text=Submitted%20by%20tim%20on%20Tue%2C,and%20defunding%20our%20public%20schools">Sue Ceglowski’s Profile | Vermont Business Magazine Journalist | Muck Rack</a>). This is a striking rebuke, essentially labeling the reform as antithetical to Vermont’s educational values. Similarly, an organization of Northeast Kingdom educators (Vermont Rural Education Collaborative, VREC) delivered a scathing critique. They stated the administration’s plan is <strong>“so far-reaching, so unfinished, and so imperfectly informed”</strong> that it will only worsen Vermont’s problems (<a href="https://vermontdailychronicle.com/nek-educators-accuse-guv-of-finger-wagging/#:~:text=VREC%20says%20the%20governor%E2%80%99s%20plan,is%20unrealistic">NEK educators accuse guv of ‘finger wagging,’ and worse - Vermont Daily Chronicle</a>). VREC accused Governor Scott’s team of <em>“leveraging a political agenda at the expense of their core duties to the field”</em> (<a href="https://vermontdailychronicle.com/nek-educators-accuse-guv-of-finger-wagging/#:~:text=politics%20over%20students">NEK educators accuse guv of ‘finger wagging,’ and worse - Vermont Daily Chronicle</a>). In other words, they see the proposal as driven by politics (and perhaps the interests of a few) rather than the best interests of students. Notably, VREC’s membership includes many superintendents and principals – the people who run our schools day-to-day – and they worry the plan is built on a “groundless foundation” (<a href="https://vermontdailychronicle.com/nek-educators-accuse-guv-of-finger-wagging/#:~:text=VREC%20says%20the%20governor%E2%80%99s%20plan,is%20unrealistic">NEK educators accuse guv of ‘finger wagging,’ and worse - Vermont Daily Chronicle</a>). Their skepticism is informed by experience: Vermont has attempted large-scale education reorganization before (like the Act 46 district consolidations a few years ago), and those efforts had mixed results and significant community resistance. School leaders caution that constant top-down “transformations” are “tired tropes” that distract from steady, data-informed improvements (<a href="https://vermontdailychronicle.com/nek-educators-accuse-guv-of-finger-wagging/#:~:text=Solutions%3F">NEK educators accuse guv of ‘finger wagging,’ and worse - Vermont Daily Chronicle</a>). Essentially, the people closest to our students are urging a pause and more collaborative approach, rather than a radical restructuring that feels imposed and unproven.</p>
        <p><strong>Teachers and Parents:</strong> Vermont’s teachers’ union, the VT-NEA, also expressed immediate concern. Right after the plan was unveiled, VT-NEA President Don Tinney called the proposal “risky” and <em>“short on the details”</em>, questioning <em>“how these changes would be better for students”</em> (<a href="https://www.vermontpublic.org/local-news/2025-01-22/state-officials-unveil-gov-scotts-education-reform-ideas#:~:text=If%20enacted%20as%20proposed%2C%20the,%E2%80%9D">State officials unveil Gov. Scott&#39;s education reform ideas | Vermont Public</a>). The union highlighted that the plan fails to explain how it would actually improve student learning or even reduce property taxes as claimed (<a href="https://www.vermontpublic.org/local-news/2025-01-22/state-officials-unveil-gov-scotts-education-reform-ideas#:~:text=a%20statement%20calling%20Scott%E2%80%99s%20proposal,%E2%80%9D">State officials unveil Gov. Scott&#39;s education reform ideas | Vermont Public</a>). This aligns with a common critique from educators: grand reorganization often produces upheaval but not necessarily better outcomes in the classroom. Many parents and community members, upon learning of the five-district scheme and potential school closures, have also voiced anxiety. Public forums and letters to editors in Vermont have featured citizens worried that local small schools could be closed by a distant authority in Montpelier, ignoring unique local circumstances. The notion of losing one’s local school board – a bedrock of town governance – does not sit well in a state where <strong>“local control”</strong> has been a cherished principle. Even those not opposed to every change in the plan find the scope of this proposal hard to swallow; <em>Seven Days</em> reported that education officials statewide were <strong>“baffled”</strong> by the sheer size of the districts and saw the plan as sidestepping more targeted solutions to issues of affordability and governance (<a href="https://vermontbiz.com/news/2025/february/09/shock-value-proposed-school-district-size-baffles-local-education-officials#:~:text=%27Shock%20value%3A%27%20Proposed%20school%20district,to%20affordability%20and%20school%20governance">&#39;Shock value:&#39; Proposed school district size baffles local education ...</a>). In the legislature, skepticism runs high across party lines. Two Democratic lawmakers quickly introduced a counter-proposal to cap the state at 25 districts instead of 5, indicating bipartisan doubt that such extreme consolidation is wise (<a href="https://vermontdailychronicle.com/lawmakers-give-25-district-counter-proposal-to-governors-5-district-model/#:~:text=By%20Michael%20Bielawski">Lawmakers give 25-district counter-proposal to Governor’s 5-district model - Vermont Daily Chronicle</a>) (<a href="https://vermontdailychronicle.com/lawmakers-give-25-district-counter-proposal-to-governors-5-district-model/#:~:text=The%20governor%20and%20the%20newly,the%20existing%2052%20supervisory%20unions">Lawmakers give 25-district counter-proposal to Governor’s 5-district model - Vermont Daily Chronicle</a>).</p>
        <p><strong>Historical Lessons of Resistance:</strong> Vermont can draw inspiration from other communities that have successfully resisted harmful education policies. In <strong>Jackson, Mississippi</strong>, as mentioned, a diverse coalition (#OurJPS) mobilized to oppose a state takeover. Their advocacy – rallies, outreach to officials, legal challenges – helped delay the takeover and brought national attention to the racial injustices involved (<a href="https://themississippilink.com/education/let-jackson-govern-its-public-schools/#:~:text=We%20believe%20the%20children%20of,to%20make%20their%20concerns%20known">Let Jackson Govern  Its Public Schools – The Mississippi Link</a>) (<a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2017/10/26/gov-bryant-orders-independent-review-of-jackson-public-schools/#:~:text=...%20mississippitoday.org%20%20A%20self,state%27s%20second%20largest%20school">Jackson Public Schools avoid takeover; Gov. Bryant orders ...</a>). That pushback showed that when a community stands united for its schools, even powerful state entities can be forced to reconsider. In <strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>, in 2022, strong leadership from Mayor Michelle Wu and public outcry from parents and students averted a looming state receivership of Boston Public Schools. Mayor Wu negotiated a deal that kept the district under local oversight while committing to improvements, explicitly saying she was <em>“glad… our discussions ultimately reinforced that Boston’s local communities know best how to deliver for our schools.”</em> (<a href="https://baystatebanner.com/2022/06/29/wu-reaches-deal-averts-receivership/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99re%20ready%20for%20the%20work,%E2%80%9D">Wu reaches deal, averts receivership – The Bay State Banner</a>). This statement underscores a key principle: local stakeholders, though sometimes struggling, are often best positioned to craft solutions if empowered and supported – not shut out. And in <strong>Vermont’s own history</strong>, when the state Supreme Court mandated funding reform in the 1990s, it was in response to grassroots pressure from property-poor towns and families who knew the existing system was unfair. Those reforms (Act 60 and Act 68) faced furious opposition from richer towns initially (recall the “gold town” protests), yet the moral and legal imperative of equity prevailed with sustained advocacy. Vermonters can similarly rally now to ensure that any education policy changes move us <em>forward</em> on equity, not backward. Already, public hearings on the proposal have seen citizens and school board members pointing out the flaws and potential disparities it would create. Such civic engagement is crucial. If the majority of Vermonters – rural and urban, wealthy and poor, white and non-white – recognize that this plan could harm our most vulnerable students, they can demand the legislature halt it. Lawmakers ultimately answer to the voters, and many have indicated they are hearing considerable unease from their districts about this plan.</p>
        <p>In sum, the response from Vermont’s education community and the broader public has been a firm <strong>“Not so fast.”</strong> They emphasize that <strong>maintaining educational equity and a strong public school system should be our north star.</strong> Changes that threaten to unravel fairness or reduce public accountability will face resolute opposition. This coalition of educators, parents, and citizens is a formidable force – one that has protected Vermont’s public schools before and can do so again. The message is clear: if the state truly wants to support our students, it must collaborate with communities, not steamroll them, and build on the equity progress already made, not reverse it.</p>
        <h2 id="-why-vermont-should-reject-the-proposal-"><strong>Why Vermont Should Reject the Proposal</strong></h2>
        <p>Vermont prides itself on an education system that, while not perfect, has sought to provide equal opportunity for every child in every town. The proposed reform, with its heavy centralization and introduction of quasi-vouchers, runs counter to that mission. The evidence from both within and beyond Vermont’s borders makes a compelling case to reject this proposal in its current form. </p>
        <p>First, adopting the plan could <strong>undo the equity</strong> that Vermont has spent decades building. Our state became a leader in school funding fairness by ensuring wealthy towns and poor towns alike could offer quality education. To now recentralize funding and allow wealth-based disparities to creep back in would be a betrayal of that legacy. Other states that have tried similar shifts have seen resource gaps widen and litigation ensue. Vermont would likely find itself back in court as the <em>Brigham</em> decision’s mandate for equity still stands – indeed, even state officials acknowledge the plan <em>“is sure to prompt debate about whether it could withstand a constitutional challenge under Brigham”</em> (<a href="https://www.vermontpublic.org/local-news/2025-01-22/state-officials-unveil-gov-scotts-education-reform-ideas#:~:text=Under%20Scott%E2%80%99s%20proposed%20plan%2C%20districts,than%20their%20less%20affluent%20counterparts">State officials unveil Gov. Scott&#39;s education reform ideas | Vermont Public</a>). Rather than invite legal battles and moral backsliding, it is wiser to strengthen the existing equitable formula (for example, by fully implementing the new weighting adjustments) than to scrap it for a risky experiment.</p>
        <p>Second, the proposal would <strong>concentrate power in ways that silence local voices</strong>, a move that Vermonters across the spectrum are uncomfortable with. From Providence to Jackson, we’ve seen that removing local oversight often correlates with policies that harm disadvantaged students. Vermont’s democratic tradition in schooling (think Town Meeting votes on school budgets) is not just quaint folklore – it’s a mechanism that forces school leaders to answer directly to the community and allows communities to shape their schools. Eliminating that in favor of five large bureaucracies and state-level control could make schools less responsive to the unique needs of Vermonters, especially those in minority or low-income communities who might not have a seat at the new decision-making tables. As Boston’s near-takeover showed, maintaining local control was critical to crafting solutions that had buy-in from those on the ground. We should trust and invest in our local educators and boards, not assume a distant agency knows best for all. <strong>If the state wants to help struggling schools, it can provide targeted support and funding – it doesn’t need to seize the reins from every school board in Vermont.</strong></p>
        <p>Third, the creeping <strong>privatization embedded in this plan poses a direct threat to public school strength and social cohesion</strong>. The voucher-like component should be especially alarming. Vermont has relatively few private or parochial schools serving K-12 (outside of some towns’ historical tuition arrangements), so a new voucher system would likely attract out-of-state corporate “education providers” or see a proliferation of low-accountability private programs. This would siphon funds and students away from public schools. We have data now that vouchers elsewhere have <em>not</em> improved outcomes overall, but have led to greater segregation and less funding for those who remain in public schools (<a href="https://firstfocus.org/resource/school-vouchers-issue-brief/#:~:text=Instead%2C%20school%20vouchers%20have%20been,access%20to%20education%20for%20LGBTQ">School Vouchers and the growing threat to public education  | First Focus on Children</a>) (<a href="https://firstfocus.org/resource/school-vouchers-issue-brief/#:~:text=This%20chronic%20underfunding%20is%20especially,the%20hardest%20by%20economic%20downturns">School Vouchers and the growing threat to public education  | First Focus on Children</a>). Our state’s small size and community-oriented nature mean that public schools are often the glue holding towns together; to erode them is to erode community itself. Even a partial shift of public money to private hands undermines the principle that <em>public funds are for public benefit</em>. Vermont voters in the past have been wary of school voucher initiatives for these reasons. It is telling that <strong>many states have seen voucher plans defeated when put to referendum</strong> – an indicator that the general public values public education, even if some politicians push “choice.” In Florida, the dramatic expansion of vouchers is very recent, but already stories are emerging of public schools having to cut programs as dollars are rerouted to private schools that face little oversight. Vermonters should ask: Who benefits from this? Perhaps a few families might get a subsidy to send a child to a private academy, but if it comes at the cost of weakening the local public school that serves the vast majority, is that a trade-off we accept? The VSBA doesn’t think so, calling out voucher expansion and public school defunding as a core problem with the plan (<a href="https://muckrack.com/sue-ceglowski#:~:text=Submitted%20by%20tim%20on%20Tue%2C,and%20defunding%20our%20public%20schools">Sue Ceglowski’s Profile | Vermont Business Magazine Journalist | Muck Rack</a>). We should listen.</p>
        <p>Finally, Vermont should reject the proposal because <strong>our communities have signaled loud and clear that they do not want it</strong>. Pushing forward in spite of widespread opposition from school boards, superintendents, teachers, and citizens would be a grave mistake. Durable education policy must have the trust and buy-in of those it affects. The rollout of this proposal has already sown confusion and distrust – one education official described local reactions as <em>“shock”</em> at its sweeping nature (<a href="https://vermontbiz.com/news/2025/february/09/shock-value-proposed-school-district-size-baffles-local-education-officials#:~:text=%27Shock%20value%3A%27%20Proposed%20school%20district,to%20affordability%20and%20school%20governance">&#39;Shock value:&#39; Proposed school district size baffles local education ...</a>). Moving ahead would likely trigger protracted battles in the Statehouse and possibly at the ballot box, diverting energy from productive improvements. Instead, Vermont’s leaders could take a different path: engage stakeholders in identifying the real problems (be it rising costs, achievement gaps, or demographic changes) and devise targeted, evidence-based solutions. Those might include things like expanded early childhood programs, better support for multilingual learners, or incentives for district collaborations – none of which require dismantling the entire governance system. The <strong>historical lesson</strong> is that education reform works best when done <em>with</em> communities, not <em>to</em> them. The defeat of an earlier version of this plan (“Designing Our Future”) a few years ago, which quietly died after stakeholder pushback, shows that top-down ideas without buy-in will not survive (<a href="https://www.chestertelegraph.org/2025/02/19/side-by-side-we-compare-two-education-plans-from-the-scott-administration/#:~:text=D%20an%20French%20resigned%20in,inform%20changes%20in%20the%20system">Side by Side: Scott education plans past and present | The Chester Telegraph</a>) (<a href="https://www.chestertelegraph.org/2025/02/19/side-by-side-we-compare-two-education-plans-from-the-scott-administration/#:~:text=early%20January%20of%20this%20year%2C%C2%A0and,totally%20in%20the%20drivers%20seat">Side by Side: Scott education plans past and present | The Chester Telegraph</a>). The current proposal is essentially that old wine in a new bottle, as critics have noted, and there is no reason to believe the outcome will be different this time if public sentiment is ignored (<a href="https://www.chestertelegraph.org/2025/02/19/side-by-side-we-compare-two-education-plans-from-the-scott-administration/#:~:text=After%20the%20Listen%20and%20Learn,totally%20in%20the%20drivers%20seat">Side by Side: Scott education plans past and present | The Chester Telegraph</a>).</p>
        <p><strong>In conclusion, Vermont should firmly reject this centralization and privatization scheme if it aims to preserve educational equity and the strength of its public schools.</strong> The risks – a reversal of fair funding, empowerment of wealthy interests, loss of local control, increased segregation, and weakened public institutions – are too great to justify the uncertain benefits. Vermont can learn from what has happened elsewhere: states that protected and invested in their public schools are now seeing better outcomes than those that went down the path of austerity, takeovers, and vouchers. By saying no to this proposal, Vermont reaffirms its commitment to equal, high-quality public education for <em>every</em> child and retains the ability to address challenges in a collaborative, thoughtful manner. The <strong>best path forward</strong> is to build on what we’ve done right – not to tear it down. As one Vermont education leader wrote, bold action is welcome, but <strong>“perhaps the brave, if not ‘bold,’ action”</strong> is to <em>“be deliberate, data-informed, and drama-free”</em> – to improve our schools with steady work rather than drastic leaps in the dark (<a href="https://vermontdailychronicle.com/nek-educators-accuse-guv-of-finger-wagging/#:~:text=Solutions%3F">NEK educators accuse guv of ‘finger wagging,’ and worse - Vermont Daily Chronicle</a>). Vermont’s students deserve nothing less than policies grounded in fairness, evidence, and the voices of the community. Rejecting this proposal is a necessary step to ensure those values endure in our education system. </p>
